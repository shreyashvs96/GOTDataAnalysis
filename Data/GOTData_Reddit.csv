Jon Targaryen. The Rightful Heir to the Seven Kingdoms.

Edit- For those wondering what this means to Dany's claim, Jon is ahead of her in succession. This is due to being the first born son of Rhaegar, as he was the first born son of Aerys. 

For those saying that by right of Conquest, that Robert usurped the Targaryen lineage. Upon his death, his ""children's"" deaths, and his brothers deaths as well, the true heir would go back to Jon (Stark) Targaryen, by way of Robert's grandmother being a Targaryen. See this [terribly drawn graphic](http://imgur.com/bJhbrAE) for that.

Cersei being Queen, is her own right of ""conquest"", which is another thing completely."

Robb is named after Robert Baratheon, Bran is named after Ned's brother Brandon, and Rickon is named after Ned's father. But then I remembered that Jon is named after Jon Arryn, the man who wasn't Ned's father, but raised him like a son. That's a really beautiful detail.

Edit: Glad so many people enjoyed this! Just want to clarify: I've always known Jon was named after Jon Arryn; it's the parallel in the relationships that dawned on me today."

So as it stands,  the plan developed in the most recent episode is as follows: to smuggle Tyrion and Davos into KL - and by smuggle they mean just row onto the coast of a city on the edge of potential invasion, in a paddle boat in plainsight of anyone who so much as looks out to the sea - so that they can talk to Jaime (who inexplicably managed to escape the Dothraki army with Bronn, despite being at most a few hundred metres away from where they fell into the lake as evidenced by Jamie's reaction upon ascension to the top) so that Jaime will convince Cersei (a step in the plan that could have equally come to fruition had they just captured jaime and sent him to Cersei) that if they get Jon (the King of the North and the only leader in Westeros 100% committed against the army of the dead) to go beyond the wall, somehow approach the army of the dead (close enough to obtain a wight and (???) put it in chains (???), but far enough that their ranging troop of seven isn't overwhelmed by the tens of thousands of wights), bring that wight back to the 7 kingdoms, and transport it all the way to King's Landing. They hope that Cersei will be convinced of the reality of the situation upon seeing the wight (which is nothing more than evidence of the existence of necromancy, something she is already aware of because of her own undead bodyguard) and not just think that this is a singular undead conjured up by Danaerys to fool her into believing of a much greater great than exists, and upon convicning Cersei of all this, then will transport all the troops of Danaerys and Cersei (as well as somehow also convincing the Westerosi troops of the great existential threat beyond the wall, so that they are willing to fight alongside Dothraki savages) across westeros to fight the army of the dead.

And this all can happen in time before the white walkers reach Eastwatch."

(Spoilers EXTENDED),7162,9/8/2017 16:59,2017-36,696,"I was just listening to the latest episode of the [Storm of Spoilers](https://www.fightinginthewarroom.com/category/storm-of-spoilers/) podcast in which the hosts did their season 7 wrap up discussion. In the last 8 min 30 seconds of the podcast, [Joanna Robinson](https://www.vanityfair.com/contributor/joanna-robinson) one of the hosts,  shared a passage from an email sent by one of their fans from Nashville called Nick. The excerpt gives a compelling insight into the clever way that GRRM hid a very conventional story and how the show ruined that in the last season. I couldn't find a transcription of the passage online so I transcribed it myself and would love your thoughts on it.

> This season pulled back the curtain on George's greatest magic trick.  No one important ever really dies in George's universe, it was always sleight of hand. Jon, Dany, Tyrion, etc...were always going to be safe until the final chapters of the story. Whereas George uses feints and misdirection to hide who the main cast really is, this season made it all too clear [that] main characters are the ones with names in the show, the ones we care about.


> Think about Jon's story arc. How many tales begin with a low or bastard born orphan, alone in the great big world, looking for his identity, only to later reveal he's really a prince? George's trick was to start the story before Jon was alone or an orphan, whereas most stories would start with Jon's story post Ned's death. Ned is our first lead, followed by Robb, etc..we feel the surprise and tragedy of Jon's orphanhood despite the fact that it's a trope. All the markers are there: a bastard? Check. Dead dad? Check. Reason to reclaim family honor? Check. But by beginning the story a generation early, George made it feel like anyone could die, even the supposed lead who was never a lead at all.


> Compare this to the fact that no one was shocked by the exposition of the brutality of Ned's father and brother surprisingly dying at the hand of Aerys, despite the unexpected twist it must have been in the moment. George continues this trend throughout the books.Who is the main cast?  I never would have guessed Davos would stick around this long, I felt the same about Theon and Reek.  Yet Quentyn seemed important, so did Beric, is Arianne gonna last? Victarion? Lady Stoneheart? Mance Rayder? Jon Connington? In the books, George introduces heroes, villains, and cannon fodder with equal care. Each has a fleshed out story, weight, and purpose, and not all of the main cast is there at the beginning. Main characters might be introduced at any moment. 


> But in the show expediency is here. World building is done and so is time with doomed characters we care about. By streamlining the plot the show has cut out the magic. No more distractions or feints, no more real surprises, which are different than shocking spectacles. No more feeling like Westeros is populated by more than our main cast. Only characters who will play a role in the Great War to come, have a role in the show. I expect more deaths now, all bittersweet endings have them, but there will be no more subversions. The subtlety is gone, just like it's disappointing to see the show ruined by brittle simplicity and plot point spoilers on websites, rather than detective work from books and production clues. It's disappointing to see George's story take a brutally straight plot line in the show. It's still entertaining as hell but expediency has taken away what has made this story special.

asoiaf,6n1deh,(Spoilers Extended) GRRM Time Interview 'I am going to finish these books; I think I have that obligation to the world and my readers',6921,7/13/2017 12:45,2017-28,1166,
asoiaf,6tu39p,(Spoilers Extended) Westerosi Genetics/ I did the incest math,6845,8/15/2017 13:27,2017-33,992,"Now that Jon and Dany seem likely to get together, I’ve seen a lot of people try to work out their exact relation. Well, I got bored and did out the math for you. ^or I tried to- i’m not 100% sure if it's right. please tell me if i’m wrong

Usually, parents and full siblings share 50% of their DNA
Aunts/uncles, half siblings, and grandparents share 25%
Cousins share 12.5%

So Dany and Jon should share 25% of their DNA, right? well, no. Targaryen family trees are a *special* kind of special. They look more like ladders than trees. 

Dany’s father and mother, Aerys and Rhaella, were full siblings. So were her grandparents, Jaehaerys and Shaera. You have to go all the way to her great-grandparents, Aegon V (Egg) and Betha Blackwood to find a couple that wasn’t closely related.* Genetically, this makes Dany half Blackwood, a fourth Dayne, and a fourth Targaryen. 

(*they were still related, of course. This is Westeros. Just not *closely** related.)

So because of all this incest Rhaegar and Daenerys weren’t just siblings. They were super-siblings. Normal siblings share 50% of their DNA. Rhaegar and Daenerys shared 88%. That’s approaching identical twin level of incest. 

**This means Jon and Dany share 44% of their DNA. Genetically, they are closer to being full siblings than to being aunt/nephew.**
(*note: I revised this number a bit. See the edits*)

For comparison:
>Cersei and Jaime share 56.3%
>Jon and the Stark kids share 13.3% 

Of course, Dany and Jon still are aunt and nephew. But they are also first cousins once removed. And second cousins once removed… and first cousins once removed. Again. 

If you want to fully understand how crazy Targaryen incest is, Daenerys’s coefficient of inbreeding is 0.375 (The higher this number, the more inbred the person is)

Alfonso XII of Spain, who basically wins at being like, the most inbred person ever, had a coefficient of only 0.25 

Now think of the original plan: marry Viserys and Daenerys. Their children would have had a coefficient of 0.5. If Craster wanted to match that level of incest, he would have to become immortal and have kids with his daughter-wives an infinite number of times. 

Edit: [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/4m4569/spoilers_extended_fun_with_asoiaf_relatedness/?st=J6DUAM4J&sh=cb7cd7ad) another good post by /u/Abner__Doon if you want to see who else is related 

Edit 2: Apologies, Alfonso XII of Spain, you lost your title. It seems Charles II and Cleopatra are more inbred than you, sorry. 

Edit 3: I’ve seen a few people mention the Blackwoods, who show up on both sides of Jon’s family tree. The problem is we don’t know how Melantha Blackwood and Betha were related. The timelines match up for them to be sisters, but they could easily be cousins or from different branches of the family entirely. So choose your own genetic adventure:
>If they are sisters, add 3.1% (to 44%)
>If cousins, add 1.6% 
>If second cousins, add 0.8%

Let's take the most incest-y (and most likely) timeline. 
Accounting ~0.6% for Targaryen incest before Aegon V (I can't get an exact number, Viserys II is making my head hurt) and assuming Betha and Melantha were sisters, we get 43.75+0.6+3.1 **Jon and Dany would be 47.45% related.** This would make Dany Jon's closest living relative, even closer than Aegon, his brother. 

Edit: And thanks for the gold!

tldr: Targaryen incest > all other incest. 

Jon and Dany are more related than you think."

asoiaf,4ng4fc,(Spoilers Extended) Lady Crane is not what we think she is.,6488,6/10/2016 12:48,2016-24,882,"OK after thinking a bit more about it, I have a prediction to add to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/4n1d68/spoilers_extended_what_arya_is_really_up_to/). It's a bit long and has a lot of analysis, so I hope people don't mind I gave it it's own post. I think watching the show again, it's unlikely that Arya is knowingly working with Jaqen to draw the Waif out. But I do think Arya's test was not what we think it was. Please accept my latest tinfoil;

Jaqen was testing both Arya and The Waif here. Arya passed her test.

The assassination was not the real test. In fact the assassination was not a real job at all - because Lady Crane is a Faceless Man. She would have survived whether the poison was drunk or not, after all she had the antidote. Note Crane is by far and away the best actor in the troupe. Of course she is, the Faceless are the best actors in the world.

Jaqen says to Arya before the job that ""A girl is not ready""; he knows fair well she's not ready to carry out proper FM assassinations. But why did he send her to kill a woman who just happened to be playing the role of Cersei Lannister, in a play about the events of her life? Coincidence? I think not.

When watching the show we see Arya's emotional response. Her last failure was failing to give up her revenge list, so *really* what she must do to become no one is to give up her hatred, and need for revenge. What's important here is Arya's reaction to the play. Shortly after poisoning Lady Crane's drink, something odd happens - Lady Crane stops Arya and questions her. Four things happen - 

* Lady Crane gives her a brief background story, nothing suspicious there, but this is also what the FM do when they play their ""game"".
* Arya responds to Lady Crane's portrayal of Cersei - this is where Arya *really* passes her test - 

>LC:""How would you change it?""
Arya:""..The queen loves her son. More than anything. And he was taken from her before she could say goodbye. She wouldn't just.. cry; she would be angry. She would want to kill the person who did this to her.""

She empathises with Cersei's loss. The effect the play had on her was not to further hate her enemies, but to understand how Cersei would feel when losing her son. She responded objectively - her judgement wasn't clouded by hatred. She even sounds like she's contrasting it with the loss of her own father.
You can see the turning point in the previous scene - When ""Joffrey"" dies, Arya is laughing about it while the crowd throw her glances of disdain. The scene *is* pretty funny, but obviously is intended to be tragic. When Lady Crane says her lines, however, Arya's face changes. She stops laughing. She understands Cersei's loss. When the scene ends, she is the first to clap.

The next two things are what personally clinched it for me;
* Lady Crane asks Arya if she likes pretending to be other people. She seems confident when she says this, like she knows Arya is not what she seems. 
* Just before that though - she asks one, very important question of Arya;

>LC: ""What is your name?""

Lady Crane isn't just asking innocuous questions. She is playing The Game Of Faces. She starts with her own story, then ends with the same question Jaqen asks of Arya. Obviously Arya has no idea, so simply answers ""Mercy"".

Jaqen also tested The Waif here though - knowing Arya would fudge the actual assassination part, he wanted to see how The Waif reacted. She expressed a desire to dispatch Arya, and in this, she failed. A girl has no desires. When The Waif contronts him, Jaqen says ""Shame. A girl had many gifts"". He is disappointed in not Arya, but The Waif. Her eagerness to kill is at odds with what it means to truly be no one. His request to make it quick is not fondness for Arya - it is a warning - one the Waif has predictably ignored when she went for the gut, and not the heart or throat.

When Arya finally dispatches The Waif I think we'll see Jaqen appear. He will inform Arya she passed her test. She will then go out into the wider world - joining the mummers under her new mentor - Lady Crane."
asoiaf,39xbe6,(Spoilers All) The reason bad things happen on GoT has changed. GoT has gone from being a show that wouldn't cheat to help the good guys to a show that will cheat to help the bad guys.,6313,6/15/2015 15:45,2015-25,2247,"When I complain about GoT lately people respond with ""That's what the show has always been, this is what you signed up for, if you think this has a happy ending you haven't been paying attention."" but I think this episode has solidified why I have a problem with the show recently.

The tragedy on the show used to be organic. People would die because GoT wasn't willing to give characters the 1 in a million lucky breaks that other shows give their protagonist.

Now the show doesn't just not give the protagonists freebies, it bends over backwards to fuck them over. Honestly, every military conflict in the last two and a half seasons has seen the wrong side winning. 

* Yara/Ashe and ""The 50 best swordsmen in the Iron Isles"" lose a fight to a shirtless guy with a knife and 3 dogs, which is roughly what you would encounter on your average domestic disturbance call. The 50 best swordsmen in the Iron Isles couldn't survive half an episode of ""Cops""

* The Unsullied and Baristan Selmy lose a fight against unarmored aristocrats with knives.

* ""20 good men"" infiltrate the camp of the greatest military tactician alive.

* The Unsullied lose another fight against unarmored aristocrats with spears, who honestly also make a pretty good showing against a dragon.

* The Boltons, despite not being supported by most of the north, and seemingly not having any massive source of money, raise an army of tens of thousands and overwhelm Stannis.

Add to that the fact that the nigh omniscient Littlefinger was apparently unaware that the Bostons were fucked up wierdos and the show seems to be bending over backwards for tragedy."

I know we're often asked to ignore the silly teleportations and supersonic flights that the show has foisted on us over the last couple of seasons. I know some of it can seem like the petty quibbles of book purists veering into circlejerk self-parody.

But geography doesn't just matter when it comes to making the universe feel real. It was also the key plot point that drove the biggest dramatic turn of the series.

The Red Wedding was literally caused by Robb Stark needing to be able to get his troops across a bridge. The Frey army was a nice addition, but Robb needed the alliance for the bridge crossing. He, his mother, his pregnant wife (in the show) and thousands of his troops died for that crossing.

So it's not just a nitpick when characters and armies magically teleport from north to south, bypassing the Twins or Moat Caitlin with nary a scout to notice them.

It destroys and makes mockery of the premise of the series' most famous narrative twist."

And that is when I realized that he is not moving his lips to read the letters anymore, thanks to Shireen. Davos then takes the letter himself and reads it with full confidence and without stumbling on any of the words. 

I just thought that was a huge nod to Shireen and her relentlessness to make Davos literate and in-turn, a better Hand. She had a profound impact on his life, and it just makes thinking about her death and his reaction to it so much more heartbreaking.

asoiaf,62rlhr,"(Spoilers Extended) Thoughts on GRRM's novelization of HBO's ""Game of Thrones""?",5925,4/1/2017 8:45,2017-13,345,"I was excited a few years ago when I heard that George R.R. Martin, the acclaimed author of ""Wild Cards"" and ""Fevre Dream"" was going to adapt HBO's hit fantasy series Game of Thrones by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss into novels.

I haven't finished them, but I want to hear any opinions from those who read all the books. There were some changes from the original series but still kinda enjoyable to read some backstories.

However here are some of my complaints for some changes. The earlier books were quite faithful to the source material but it strayed off at one point and keeps adding meaningless characters. I don't know why he aged down the characters and it's kinda creepy for some scenes and book is unnecessarily vulgar. I'm not reading for some fetishized erofic of a fat 60 year old man as I imagine him sweating profusely while typing onto the grimy keyboard. And purple eyes are fucking anime-tier addition and feel a bit cringey.  Also why did he make Tyrion such an insufferable asshole in later books? Stannis is kinda whitewashed on the other hand, as well as Ellaria Sand. Complicated motivations of Shae's betrayal is skipped over. He also skipped Arya-Tywin moments which was one of my favorite part of Season 2. Most of all Catelyn coming back as a zombie (possibly in an attempt to cash in on the recent popularity of The Walking Dead) while killing Beric off is completely incomprehensible and out of character.

I liked what he did with Dorne though and liked Arianna Grande. So, thoughts?

Let's go back to what we know about each character.

When Dany meets Daario she notices his flamboyant Tyroshi style:

> Daario Naharis was flamboyant even for a Tyroshi. His beard was cut into three prongs and **dyed blue**, the same color as his eyes and the curly hair that fell to his collar. His pointed mustachios were **painted gold**.

Now what do we know about Euron? He drinks a very particular beverage. 

> ""I mean to open your eyes."" Euron drank deep from his own cup, and smiled. ""Shade-of-the-evening, the **wine of the warlocks**.""

So we know that Euron is drinking shade-of-the evening, which is connected with the Pyat Pree and the warlocks. Where do the warlocks live? The House of the Undying.

**Un-dying**.

Now how could Euron -- who we know has a connection to the **un-dying** ones -- also be Daario who actively participates in **dyeing**?

Characters made strange and erratic decisions, inconsistencies in time and geography were pervasive, and the writers frequently resorted to one of the most contrived plot devices in storytelling: the ""Deus ex Machina"".

The first time it was used in the episode was when it appeared that Tormund was going to be killed by wights. I think Tormund should have died here for the same reasons I think Bronn should have died in ""The Spoils of War"": he's a lovable character but not vital. He's important enough as a character for his death to be moving, but he lacks a major, series-spanning character arc to fulfill. This makes him expendable. It would have been very haunting and impactful to see Tormund die screaming for help. It would make the White Walkers and the wights appear even more threatening, and it would have added more emotional depth to the episode. But Tormund did not die, as The Hound saved him at the last minute. I felt cheated. I had forgiven the writers for letting Bronn live in Episode 4, but this was the penultimate episode of the season. Viewers are expecting major events to unfold, and it's disappointing when the writers seem to shy away from such events.

The second usage of the Deus ex Machina in ""Beyond the Wall"" was when Daenerys showed up with her dragons. Now I've dismissed all ""fast traveling"" complaints in the past, assuming that the storylines are just out of sync, but this was really pushing it. It's safe to say it would have taken *at least* 2 days for Daenerys to receive the Raven and fly up beyond the wall. If Jon's party was stranded in that spot for two whole days, the writers didn't do a good job of showing it. Nonetheless, Dany did show up, and she rescued the surviving party (excluding Jon, who for some reason decided to keep fighting wights). If the wights had actually inflicted more damage on Jon's group by the time Dany arrived, I might have forgiven the writers for this instance of the Deus ex Machina. But only Thoros and several unnamed wildlings had been killed at this point, so it really didn't feel like Jon's party was in a lot of danger.

The final Deus ex Machina in the episode was the appearance of Benjen. This one is pretty ridiculous. First of all, it's extremely convenient for him to show up at this particular place beyond the Wall just when Jon is about to die. Secondly, Benjen couldn't ride away on his horse with Jon because ""there's no time"". Seriously!? I would've been somewhat satisfied if Benjen had said something like ""I'll just slow you down"", but ""there's no time""? He could be halfway up on his horse by the time he finished saying that sentence. Ultimately, this whole mess was written just to tie up the loose end that was Benjen, and it was handled very poorly.

Because of the abundant usage of the Deus ex Machina in ""Beyond the Wall"", 6 of the 7 characters in Jon's party survived the journey. Personally, I think it's pretty disappointing that when 7 big characters go on a very dangerous mission together in the penultimate episode of the season, only one dies, and that one character is arguably the least-developed of the bunch. I will admit that Viserion's death was pretty emotional, but I believe it would've been more impactful to see a developed and popular character like Tormund die.

The writers keep copping out with these last minute rescues, and it's really demonstrating their inability to take big risks. Maybe I'm speaking too soon, and the writers are building up to some kind of mass murder scene (like The Red Wedding or Cersei's bombing of the Sept of Baelor), but so far, they really seem to be pulling their punches by using this all too convenient plot device.


Edit: It's been made clear to me that I've incorrectly classified some things as ""Deus ex Machina"", and I apologize for misusing the term. My mistake. However, even if I put the wrong label on it, my point remains that the repeating cycle of 'Person A' being in trouble and 'Person B' saving them at the very last second is getting quite tiresome."

## What is known of the Others?  

The creatures themselves are encountered in the prologue, the battle at the Fist of the First Men, and when Sam kills one with a piece of Obsidian.  

*What else do we know about them?*

Precious little. They have a language, they make things out of ice with magical properties, and they raise the dead to fight for them. We can infer a few other things from conversations about them. Tormund has quite a bit to say: 

>They’re never far, you know. They won’t come out by day, not when that old sun’s shining, but don’t think that means they went away. Shadows never go away. Might be you don’t see them, but they’re always clinging to your heels.  

>When the snows came though…snow and sleet and freezing rain, its bloody hard to find dry wood or get your kindling lit, and the cold…some nights our fires just seemed to shrivel up and die. Nights like that, you always find some dead come the morning. ‘Less they find you first.

>A man can fight the dead, but when their masters come, when the white mists rise up … how do you fights a mist crow? Shadows with teeth … air so cold it hurts to breath, like a knife inside your chest … you do not know, you cannot know … can your sword cut cold?  

The interesting thing here is that Tormund describes the Others as mists and shadows. He never mentions ice swords that shatter steel or camouflage armor or anything specific about their appearance.  

This suggests that he, at least, hasn't had direct contact with them... unless they can take the form of mist. 

Old Nan's stories are the other frequently cited source on the Others. Synopses can be found [here](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Nan)

The story we're presented in the book through Nan's stories and various others' recountings and rumination is that several thousand years ago, following a mythological Age of Heroes, the Others came from the far North; prior to that point they were unknown. 

According to the tales, the Others brought with them a night that lasted a generation (or the night brought them) and essentially wiped out civilization except for a small number of humans that *somehow* managed to drive them back. All we know about this retaliation and eventual victory is that it resulted in the construction of an enormous magical Wall of ice that, apparently, holds the others at bay.  

Westerosi attribute this to a figure called the Last Hero, who may or may not be the same figure as Azor Ahai, an Eastern figure associated with the R'hllor faith. Azor Ahai's magic weapon may be an allegory for the process of taming dragons or creating Valyrian steel, either of which may involve human sacrifice as in the story. 

However, there is another point to consider.  

Melisandre, the only source we have on the Others outside tales and garbled legends passed down orally from a time so long ago there are no accurate histories of it, says the Others are demons of snow, ice, and cold, and essentially paints them as mindless servants of a single intelligence that opposes her fire god.  

What if she's wrong? 

## An Alternate Theory ##

Ever since the tale of the Night's King appeared in the books, people have been speculating that it foreshadows someone turning to the side of the Others. Candidates for this include Roose Bolton and Stannis, the former for an apparent connection to magic, agelessness, and a general inhuman eeriness, the latter for his hunger for power, ruthless pragmatism, and possibility of snapping and going ""dark"" when it becomes clear he will never sit the Iron Throne. 

The Night's King story is not a random horror tale. It's an explanation of how the war against the Others was won.  

The story of the Last Hero as related by Old Nan ends with the Others closing in and the Last Hero, who is defenseless. It is never said he fought or defeated or conquered them.  

We know that there has already been a peace between human and inhuman/supernatural beings in Westeros. The First Men and the Children came to terms and agreed to a peace treaty (which was later broken by the Andal invaders)

I propose that the Last Hero was not a conqueror, but a diplomat. An agreement was reached between Men and the Others. It was *the Others themselves* that raised the magical wall of ice, not to seal themselves off but to mark their territory and protect themselves from a dangerous source of fire magic to the south of their domain. 

This pact was sealed as many agreements in the series are, with a marriage. A Stark or one of the ancestors of the Starks married the queen of the Others and reigned at the Wall, presiding jointly with his strange bride over a sort of demilitarized zone between Men and Others. 

The Others, then, fulfilled their side of the agreement. They went away and left Men alone.  

Men, unfortunately, did not keep up their end of the bargain. A large population of them has taken up residence on the wrong side of the Wall. They may be violating some now unknown and unremembered term of the agreement.  

Could this be why Craster sacrifices his sons to the Others, and is left alone? Perhaps he simply rediscovered, by accident, part of this treaty or pact, and in fulfilling it was left in peace. We assume that the Others are doing something evil with the babies because they look and, apparently, act evil, but are they? 

*The Others attack the Night's Watch in force,* but never the wildings. Why? 

Simply put, the charter of the Watch goes both ways. They're not supposed to intervene in southern affairs, nor are they to intervene in *northern* affairs. 

This brings me back to the Night's King. At some point, the Watch had a change in leadership and the hereditary House of the proto-Stark and his Other bride were deposed and replaced by the system of choosing. This is all remembered in the tale of the Night's King's downfall.

The Night's Watch, in the view of the Others, has broken the treaty and the Others are working to destroy them, most actively when they invade the North in the form of the Great Ranging. 

The Wildings are simply herded south. The Others pick at their fringes and push them towards the Wall. The goal is not to exterminate them but to get them out. Men are no longer keeping their side of the agreement, so the Others are no longer obligated to keep theirs. 

## The Kings of Winter and the Dragonlords ##

If this theory is true, in ancient times the Starks and the Others (or the ruling family or class or whatever of the Others) were intermarried and allied. They were the Kings of Winter. Winter is Coming.  

When Catelyn reflects on Ned's house worse, she's *wrong*. ""Winter is Coming"" is not a warning of hardship to come, it *is* a threat in the vein of Hear me Roar or a boast like Growing Strong. 

The Starks have an innate connection to magic and the Earth, and the stories suggest links to the far north and the Others, hinting that the Starks have blood from beyond the Wall running through their veins. 

This places them in direct opposition to the dragonlords. The Valyrians are not normal human beings. Humans generally don't have purple eyes and silver hair. They are not immune to fire but they do possess an affinity for heat, just like a Stark can freeze to death but Ned is comfortable sleeping in the nude in Winterfell. They also have some magical connection to dragons. (This is a seperate topic, but I propose that the whips and 'sorcerous horns' like Dragonbinder that Dany thinks about in her ADWD chapter came about after the magical blood of the Valyrians began to fade and they gradually lost control over their dragons. The trait was strong in the Targs who managed to escape before the subcontinent went boom, but faded with them as well as the dragons died out)

Something big is happening with magic. Typically, theorists try to trace the return of magic to either the Others returning or the dragons being reborn but both of these are effects preceded by a cause. 

We have some clues to what that cause might be. Daenerys, Jon, and Robb, all magical children with the traits of their ancestors, were born roughly at the same time. Daenerys was the first succesful Targ to hatch dragons since they died out, and Jon and Robb are the first Stark wargs since... whenever they stopped being wargs.

It all comes back to Rhaegar. 

The return of the Others isn't an apocalypse that must be prevented by harnessing the power of fire to drive them back. Rhaegar knew this and understood that the only way to preserve the human race is *balance* between Ice and Fire.

The Others will not be so forviging this time. Humans have shown they can't be trusted not to encroach on the Others' territory and play with fire magic and risk destroying the world, so the Others have come to wipe them out- not out of pure, senseless malice (the ""reckless hate"" of Tolkien's Sauron and orcs) but out of a drive to survive. The Others believe they're saving the world from Men who will, unchecked, destroy it. 

That's where Jon comes in. Jon is Rhaegar's Song of Ice and Fire. This is why he dreams of himself sheathed in ice wielding a flaming sword. Jon has the blood of dragonriders and wargs and the blood of the Others through the Starks and the blood of the dragon (or something else) through the Targaryens. Jon's purpose and power isn't to defeat either side -the idea of one person, flaming sword and dragon or not, winning a war singlehandedly in this universe is laughably absurd- but to restore peace between them. 

The Prince who was Promised is not Azor Ahai. Azor Ahai is the villain in the Prince's story, and Azor Ahai is Daenerys Targaryen. The purpose of Rhaegar's prophecy and ""abduction"" of Lyanna was, in part, to prevent his own sister from destroying the world, by passing kingship to his child of ice and fire instead of to her. 

All of this was foretold in prophecy. Who says the Others don't have prophecy, too?


## What woke the Others? ##

Assuming that they aren't mindless destroyers but an actual culture, what would bring the Others south?  Could it be... 

* The decline of the Night's Watch
* The murder of the Stark lord and his heir by the Targaryen king?
* Their own prophecy of dragons returning to destroy them?

We don't know how long the Others were active or how quickly they move or organize themselves. Immortal beings, if they are immortal or very long lived, probably work on a different time scale. Waymar Royce and his party were probably not the first to encounter them, just the first time a survivor carried word South. In fact, the Others may have let Gared live as a final warning to the Night's Watch and the realms of men. Stay out, or we're coming. 

We do know that Mance Rayder started gathering the wildings together to get the hell out of Dodge well before the encounter in the prologue, suggesting the Others were active well before that. 


## How will it end? ##

An epic battle between the forces of Men and the Others that ends in their total defeat and banishment from the world and a new era of peace and balanced seasons just doesn't fit with the story as told.  

If I'm right, the Others are not so different from Men, and the greater conflict not so different from the smaller one. Pacts were made, backstabbing and broken oaths occurred, and now there's war. 

It will end the way it did the first time, in an uneasy truce brokered by Jon, rather than a smashing victory over cold and evil by Daenerys. The Others may even *ally* with Men to destroy the threat of the Targaryens and their dragons before retreating north again, satisfied that Men will honor their agreement for now. 

In the house of the Undying Dany has a vision of a blue rose growing from the wall. While obviously forshadowing that Lyanna's son Jon is present at the Wall, there's a second layer to this that suggests a rebirth of the Stark line on the Wall; the same imagery is used in the story of Bael the Bard. 

Jon will become King on the Wall and to seal the peace, take an Other to bride, as did the Night's King of old. Not an easy or perfect or permanent peace, just a peace. 

tl:dr: The Others are moving south because Men violated an ancient pact with them. The Night's King story is an account of how the War for the Dawn ended, in a peace sealed by marriage. Daenerys and her dragons are a dangerous force of chaos that threatens to destabilized the world, and the Others are hostile towards Men because of their betrayal of the Night's King and overthrow of his line, their incursion into the Other's agreed on terrritory, and the danger the Targs and their fire magic pose to the Others and the world at large. Rhaegar fathered a son by Lyanna to unite the blood of the dragonriders and the Other-kin, whether he knew it or not. Jon is that son and will bring peace between the Others and the realms of men. 

Edit: I really wasn't expecting gold for this. Thanks!"

He has directed 4 episodes, all of which are in the lowest 17 of 58 episodes. 3 of those are in the bottom 10 worst episodes.  Either he doesn't understand the complexities of GOT, or he was just given terrible scripts, something just doesn't come together when he directs episodes. 

Edit: I am not comparing GoT to other shows, simply to itself and it's high standards. 

Also, As many have pointed out, there is a lot that goes into making an episode, and I understand that fact. However, it is ultimately the directors job to make sure the final product is a masterpiece. 

Finally, I do not want to strip Mylad of future work per se, but it does seem that episodes he has directed involved errors in continuity, cringeworthy scenes, etc

He did such a wonderful job portraying Ramsay as evidenced by the sheer amount of hatred his portrayal inspired. It's also a testament to his acting ability that he was the second choice to play Jon Snow, and that the creators' liked him so much that they brought him back to play Ramsay. I kinda feel bad for him though, because he could have played arguably the most popular/loved character on the show and instead he played the most hated. Either way, I think he did a really great job with the role he was given.

He was also great in the comedy tv shows Misfits and Vicious. The characters he portrays in those are nothing like Ramsay. If you haven't seen them, I highly recommend that you do. "

* Rhaegar and Lyanna were married

* Jon is the rightful king 

* Dany and Jon hook up

I wanted to show that the books have long been hinting that this was the case.

**1)**

> ""Why aren't you down in the yard?"" Arya asked him.

> He gave her a half smile. ""**Bastards are not allowed to damage young princes**,"" he said. ""Any bruises they take in the practice yard must come from **trueborn** swords."" (Arya I, AGOT)

Jon says that the reason he’s not down in the yard with Joffrey and Tommen is because “Bastards are not allowed to damage young princes.” The irony is that Joffrey and Tommen are actually bastards who were raised as trueborn princes, which makes Jon the trueborn prince who was raised as a bastard.

**2)**

> ""My father had no time for books."" Joffrey shoved the tome across the table. ""If you read less, Uncle Imp, perhaps Lady Sansa would have a baby in her belly by now."" **He laughed . . . and when the king laughs, the court laughs with him**. (Sansa IV, ASOS 59)

And then a few chapters later:

> He laughed, and Pyp and Owen and half a dozen more laughed with him. 

> [...]

> Jon laughed, laughed like a drunk or a madman, and his men laughed with him. (Jon VIII, ASOS 64)

Jon (the king) laughs, and his men (the equivalent of his court) laugh with him. Also note that Jon laughs like “a drunk or a madman,” and the previous two kings of Westeros were a drunk (Robert) and a madman (Aerys):

> Barristan Selmy could not dispute the truth of that. He had spent the best part of his own life **obeying the commands of drunkards and madmen**. (The Queen's Hand, ADWD)

-
> TYWIN: You’ve served as a glorified bodyguard for **two kings, one a madman, the other a drunk**. ([S1E7](https://youtu.be/47MazYDnmaU?t=3m44s))

**3)** Craster meeting Jon for the first time:

> ""Who's this one now?"" Craster said before Jon could go. ""He has the look of a Stark.""

> ""My steward and squire, Jon Snow.""

> ""**A bastard, is it?**"" Craster looked Jon up and down. ""**Man wants to bed a woman, seems like he ought to take her to wife**. That's what I do."" He shooed Jon off with a wave. ""Well, run and do your service, bastard, and see that axe is good and sharp now, I've no use for dull steel."" (Jon III, ACOK)

**4)** Gilly talking to Jon:

> Her breath frosted the air in small nervous puffs. ""They say the king gives justice and protects the weak."" She started to climb off the rock, awkwardly, but the ice had made it slippery and her foot went out from under her. Jon caught her before she could fall, and helped her safely down. The woman knelt on the icy ground. ""M'lord, I beg you—"" (Jon III, ACOK)

Gilly says the king protects the weak, and then Jon catches her before she can fall, protecting the weak. Gilly then kneels before him, and not for the last time:

> When Gilly entered, **she went at once to her knees**. Jon came around the table and drew her to her feet. ""You don't need to take a knee for me. **That's just for kings**."" (Jon II, ADWD)

**5)**

> It was a good story, Bran decided after thinking about it a moment or two. ""Then what happened? **Did the Knight of the Laughing Tree win the tourney and marry a princess?**""

> ""**No**,"" said Meera. ""That night at the great castle, the storm lord and the knight of skulls and kisses each swore they would unmask him, and the king himself urged men to challenge him, declaring that the face behind that helm was no friend of his. But the next morning, when the heralds blew their trumpets and the king took his seat, only two champions appeared. The Knight of the Laughing Tree had vanished. The king was wroth, and even sent his son the dragon prince to seek the man, but all they ever found was his painted shield, hanging abandoned in a tree. **It was the dragon prince who won that tourney in the end**."" (Bran II, ASOS)

Bran almost had it right. He just got it the wrong way round:
 The Knight of the Laughing Tree didn’t win the tourney and marry a princess; The prince won the tourney and married the Knight of the Laughing Tree (Lyanna).

**6)**

> ""And here he has remained, while his brother and his brother's son and his son each reigned and died in turn, until Jaime Lannister put an end to the **line of the Dragonkings**.""

> ""**King**,"" croaked the raven. The bird flapped across the solar to land on Mormont's shoulder. ""**King**,"" it said again, strutting back and forth.

> ""He likes that word,"" Jon said, smiling.

> ""An easy word to say. An easy word to like.""

> ""**King**,"" the bird said again.

> ""**I think he means for you to have a crown**, my lord.""

> ""The realm has three kings already, and that's two too many for my liking."" Mormont stroked the raven under the beak with a finger, but all the while **his eyes never left Jon Snow**.

> **It made him feel odd**. (Jon I, ACOK)

The line of the Dragonkings isn’t over after all.

> He rose and dressed in darkness, as Mormont's raven muttered across the room. ""Corn,"" the bird said, and, ""**King**,"" and, ""**Snow, Jon Snow, Jon Snow**."" That was queer. The bird had never said his full name before, as best Jon could recall. (Jon XII, ADWD)

**7)**

> ""The Lady Melisandre tells us that sometimes R'hllor permits his faithful servants to glimpse the future in flames. It seemed to me as I watched the fire this morning that I was looking at a dozen beautiful **dancers, maidens garbed in yellow silk spinning and swirling before a great king**. I think it was a true vision, ser. A glimpse of the glory that awaits **His Grace** after we take King's Landing and **the throne that is his by rights**."" (Davos I, ACOK)

Ser Axell Florent was referring to Stannis here (although you can’t tell that from this passage alone, which conveniently uses male pronouns), but later in ACOK almost the exact same imagery appears in front of Jon while he is tending a fire, indicating that he is actually the “great king” to whom the throne belongs:

> Jon went to cut more branches, snapping each one in two before tossing it into the flames. The tree had been dead a long time, but it seemed to live again in the fire, as fiery **dancers woke within each stick of wood to whirl and spin in their glowing gowns of yellow**, red, and orange. (Jon VIII, ACOK)

And when Jon first starts this fire, Qhorin says that it’s “As shy as a *maid* on her wedding night,” which further connects this to Axell’s vision, where the dancers are specifically described as *maidens*.

**8)**

> ""Her duty."" The word felt cold upon her tongue. ""You saw my brother Rhaegar wed. **Tell me, did he wed for love or duty?**""

> The old knight hesitated. ""Princess Elia was a good woman, Your Grace. She was kind and clever, with a gentle heart and a sweet wit. I know the prince was very fond of her.""

> Fond, thought Dany. The word spoke volumes. I could become fond of Hizdahr zo Loraq, in time. Perhaps. (Daenerys IV, ADWD)

The answer to Dany’s question is: Both. Rhaegar wed Elia for duty, but Lyanna for love.

**9)** In the books it's clear that Jon will warg into Ghost for a second life after his stabbing:

> He had known what Snow was the moment he saw that great white direwolf stalking silent at his side. One skinchanger can always sense another. Mance should have let me take the direwolf. **There would be a second life worthy of a king**. He could have done it, he did not doubt. The gift was strong in Snow, but the youth was untaught, still fighting his nature when he should have gloried in it. (Prologue, ADWD)

**10)** Jon is called a ""black bastard"" multiple times by other characters:

> As the last strains of ""The Dornishman's Wife"" faded, the bald earless man glanced up from his map and scowled ferociously at Rattleshirt and Ygritte, with Jon between them. ""What's this?"" he said. ""A crow?"" 

> ""**The black bastard** what gutted Orell,"" said Rattleshirt, ""and a bloody warg as well."" (Jon I, ASOS)

-
> But they were all dead now, even Arya, everyone but her half-brother, Jon. Some nights she heard talk of him, in the taverns and brothels of the Ragman's Harbor. **The Black Bastard of the Wall**, one man had called him. (The Blind Girl, ADWD)

-
> The wildling pulled off the band from his left arm and tossed it at Jon, then did the same with its twin upon his right. ""Your first payment. Had those from my father and him from his. Now they're yours, **you thieving black bastard**."" (Jon XI, ADWD)

-
> One by one Arya had chased them down and snatched them up and brought them proudly to Syrio Forel … all but this one, this one-eared black devil of a tomcat. ""**That's the real king of this castle** right there,"" one of the gold cloaks had told her. ""Older than sin and twice as mean. One time, the king was feasting the queen's father, and **that black bastard** hopped up on the table and snatched a roast quail right out of Lord Tywin's fingers. Robert laughed so hard he like to burst. You stay away from that one, child."" (Arya III, AGOT)

And ""that black bastard"" is ""the real king of this castle.""

**11)** Remember where Jon was seated during the Winterfell feast:

> A singer was playing the high harp and reciting a ballad, but down **at this end of the hall** his voice could scarcely be heard above the roar of the fire, the clangor of pewter plates and cups, and the low mutter of a hundred drunken conversations.

> ___

> His brothers and sisters had not been permitted to bring their wolves to the banquet, but there were more curs than Jon could count **at this end of the hall**, and no one had said a word about his pup.

> ___

> His uncle glanced over his shoulder at the raised table **at the far end of the hall**. (Jon I, AGOT)

-
> Khal Drogo rose, spat out a dozen words in Dothraki, faster than Dany could understand, and pointed. ""Khal Drogo says your place is not on the high bench,"" Ser Jorah translated for her brother. ""Khal Drogo says your place is there.""

> Viserys glanced where the khal was pointing. **At the back of the long hall**, in a corner by the wall, deep in shadow so better men would not need to look on them, sat the lowest of the low; raw unblooded boys, old men with clouded eyes and stiff joints, the dim-witted and the maimed. Far from the meat, and farther from honor. ""**That is no place for a king**,"" her brother declared. (Daenerys V, AGOT)

([This comment](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/86094-a-king-in-hiding-adding-it-all-up-part-2/&page=5#comment-5663950) by J. Stargaryen on the Westeros forums points out more parallels between these scenes.)

**12)** When Alys Karstark appeals for Jon's help:

> ""**Marriages and inheritance are matters for the king**, my lady. I will write to Stannis on your behalf, but—""

> [...]

> ""Arnolf is rushing to Winterfell, 'tis true, but only so he might put his dagger in your king's back. He cast his lot with Roose Bolton long ago … for gold, the promise of a pardon, and poor Harry's head. Lord Stannis is marching to a slaughter. So he cannot help me, and would not even if he could."" **Alys knelt before him**, clutching the black cloak. ""You are my only hope, Lord Snow. **In your father's name**, I beg you. Protect me."" (Jon IX, ADWD)

""Marriages and inheritance are matters for the king,"" Jon protests. And then he helps her anyway by arranging her marriage to Sigorn:

> ""Will my lord be feasting with us?"" Mully asked Jon Snow.

> ""Shortly."" Sigorn might take it as a slight if he did not appear. **And this marriage is mine own work, after all**. (Jon X, ADWD)

**13)** A nice little bit of wordplay:

> ""I didn't catch anything,"" Bran said, ""but Jon gave me his fish on the way back to Winterfell. **Will we ever see Jon again?**""

> ""We saw Uncle Benjen when **the king came to visit**,"" Robb pointed out. ""**Jon will visit too**, you'll see."" (Bran V, AGOT)

**14)** It’s no wonder GRRM was quick to end this chat with a fan:

> *Tigers14: another question, can NW vows be annulled if a person had no idea who he really was when he took them?*

> GeoRR: who had no idea who he was?

> *Tigers14: jon*

> GeoRR: Jon knows who he is. He may not know who his mother is, but that's not the same thing. There are plenty of orphans and bastards in the Watch who don't know who their parents are.

> *Tigers14: yes. but if jon is the legitimate son of rhaegar and lyanna , he is the king of westeros.*

> GeoRR: well, you know I am not going to get into any of that

> GeoRR: I think I've said enough for tonight.

**15)** Credit to Westeros.org’s ""A King in Hiding"" threads, where I first saw many of the above clues mentioned:

[A King in Hiding: Adding It All Up](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/79816-a-king-in-hiding-adding-it-all-up/)

[A King in Hiding: Adding It All Up Part 2](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/86094-a-king-in-hiding-adding-it-all-up-part-2/)

## Dany and Jon

**16)** They both feel alone even while sleeping beside their respective lovers:

> Jon wondered where Ghost was now. Had he gone to Castle Black, or was he was running with some wolfpack in the woods? He had no sense of the direwolf, not even in his dreams. It made him feel as if part of himself had been cut off. **Even with Ygritte sleeping beside him, he felt alone**. (Jon V, ASOS)

-
> Beneath her coverlets she tossed and turned, dreaming that Hizdahr was kissing her … but his lips were blue and bruised, and when he thrust himself inside her, his manhood was cold as ice. She sat up with her hair disheveled and the bedclothes atangle. **Her captain slept beside her, yet she was alone**. (Daenerys VII, ADWD)

They won't feel alone once they sleep with each other, though.

**17)** Jon is symbolically represented in Dany's ""bride of fire"" visions in the House of the Undying, along with Drogo, Dany's first husband and lover:

-
> Her silver was trotting through the grass, to a darkling stream beneath a sea of stars [wedding night with Drogo]. A corpse stood at the prow of a ship, eyes bright in his dead face, grey lips smiling sadly. **A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice, and filled the air with sweetness**. . . . mother of dragons, **bride of fire** . . . (Daenerys IV, ACOK)

**18)** Another link between Jon and Drogo:

> The boy absorbed that all in silence. He had the Stark face if not the name: long, solemn, guarded, **a face that gave nothing away**. (Tyrion II, AGOT)

-
> Toward the end, Dany thought she glimpsed a fierce pride in his dark, almond-shaped eyes, but she could not be sure. **The khal's face did not often betray the thoughts within**. (Daenerys V, AGOT)

**19)** Speaking of Jon's face:

> What Dany wanted she could not begin to say, but Jorah's kiss had woken something in her, something that had been sleeping since Khal Drogo died. Lying abed in her narrow bunk, she found herself wondering how it would be to have a man squeezed in beside her in place of her handmaid, and the thought was more exciting than it should have been. Sometimes she would close her eyes and dream of him, but it was never Jorah Mormont she dreamed of; **her lover** was always younger and more comely, though **his face remained a shifting shadow**. (Daenerys II, ASOS)

-
> The flames crackled softly, and in their crackling she heard the whispered name Jon Snow. **His long face floated before her**, limned in tongues of red and orange, appearing and disappearing again, **a shadow half-seen behind a fluttering curtain**. (Melisandre I, ADWD)

**20)** Val is a ""princess"" who Jon is attracted to and thought about marrying. On one occasion her hair looked pale silver:

> When they emerged north of the Wall, through a thick door made of freshly hewn green wood, the wildling princess paused for a moment to gaze out across the snow-covered field where King Stannis had won his battle. Beyond, the haunted forest waited, dark and silent. The light of the half-moon turned Val's honey-blond **hair a pale silver** and left her cheeks as white as snow. She took a deep breath. ""The air tastes sweet."" (Jon VIII, ADWD)

The same colour as Dany's:

> The old woman washed her long, **silver-pale hair** and gently combed out the snags, all in silence. (Daenerys I, AGOT)

In the same passage Val says ""the air tastes sweet"" while standing next to Jon near the Wall, which brings to mind Dany's House of the Undying vision mentioned above: ""A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice, and *filled the air with sweetness*.""

**21)** Dany thought about marrying ""her brother's son"":

> Five Aegons had ruled the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. There would have been a sixth, but the Usurper's dogs had murdered **her brother's son** when he was still a babe at the breast. **If he had lived, I might have married him**. Aegon would have been closer to my age than Viserys. (Daenerys I, ADWD)

And Jon is even closer to her age.

**22)** One chapter after Jon is stabbed, Dany hears a wolf howl in the distance and feels lonely:

I thought it was about Sean Bean and Robb Stark?""

> But he knew from the very beginning where he was driving and now we're starting to see that come to fruition. **We know that it's circling tighter and tighter on Dany and Jon and their partnership is starting to form, you know, ""fire and ice.""**

> Renfro: Do you know if he was specific back then about them becoming romantically involved, since that's really only just become ""official"" in this latest season seven episode?

> Taylor: I think it's become more official but it's been coming for awhile, so much so that it's not only starting to happen but Tyrion sees it coming enough that he's making fun of her for it. He can see what's brewing.

> **I can't say much more about what [Martin] said about where we're going with Dany and Jon because that leaps ahead into the next season, but to me the revelation was that, at the time, we had a hundred characters and yet he knew it's about these two.**

Bran's head has been overloaded. The Three-Eyed Raven stated quite explicitly that Bran was not ready for this,  but due to Bran's dumb childish move, he now has to take on the history of the world as an unprepared teenager.

>Three-Eyed Raven: It is time for you to become me.

>Bran: Am I ready?

>Three-Eyed Raven: **No.**

After the Three-Eyed Raven's death, just before Bran and Mera got to the Wall, Bran crawls toward the Weirwood.

Mera asks
>""Are you sure you’re ready for this?""

Bran responds
>""I’m the Three-Eyed Raven now. **I have to be ready for this.**""

He then wargs into the tree and we see the R + L = J reveal.

THAT was the moment it happened, that was the point where Bran didn't just look into the past, he took the past into him. He opened his mind to the flow of information and history coming from the Weirwood trees. That's why Bran didn't act weird during the scenes prior because he has not yet taken the big leap and let it all happen. Mera and Bran knew it would happen, that's why Mera asked him if he was ready.

And it's fucking him up because he **wasn't ready**. He has a constant stream of information pouring into his head, and it's addled him. He isn't behaving like normal because he isn't himself right now. He's discombobulated, spitting out information when something triggers a memory he's downloaded because that's all he can think to do.

He met Dolorous Edd, so all the events regarding Edd that he'd downloaded from the tree came streaming to the forefront of his mind, but he can't process it all so he just recited them aloud. Sansa spoke to him in the Godswood, so he remembered the last time she was in the Godswood and spoke about it aloud. He didn't mean to hurt Sansa, he just isn't thinking clearly. He's vocalizing his internal thoughts, not aware of what he's doing. Not unlike someone who has been concussed.

Cut the guy some slack, he's been through hell, and he's taken on an incredible burden he doesn't know how to handle yet.      

**Edit:** [Isaac Hempstead Wright himself said in an interview about Bran and Sansa's reunion:](https://winteriscoming.net/2017/07/31/isaac-hempstead-wright-bran-sansa-stark-reunion/)

>""It’s like imagining you have all of space and time in your head. Bran is existing in thousands of planes of existence at any one time. So it’s quite difficult for Bran to have any kind of semblance of personality anymore because he’s really like a giant computer""

>“Bran really at this stage is not the Three-Eyed Raven. He’s got the title but hasn’t had thousands of years of sitting in a cave looking through time. Somebody put in front of him a massive encyclopedia of all of time and he’s only opened page one. He can look stuff up but doesn’t have this all-knowing all-seeing capability just yet.”

[Also, Davin Beinoff has said](http://ew.com/tv/2017/07/30/game-of-thrones-bran-stark-reunion/):

>“There was supposed to be more time to learn what he needed to know and they ran out of time. Now Bran the Broken is broken in more ways than one. He’s got serious challenges dealing with all the stuff happening in his mind and that prevents him becoming this omniscient character.”"

asoiaf,4ltrm9,"(Spoilers Everything) Three Villains, Three Acts, and Three Heads of the Dragon",4494,5/31/2016 5:56,2016-23,614,"After seeing Euron depicted in the show this season of Game of Thrones and reading the new Damphair chapter that heavily features Euron, I started thinking about his purpose as a character and overall the villains of A Song of Ice and Fire. George has always written grey characters, but I think despite the lack of true black and white, he's actually create a series of villains that, while not necessarily the representation of all evil like a Sauron, are the prime evil representations of different themes. And more importantly, these thematically evil villains have their foils. If you view the entire series from the perspective of a three act structure (Act I - AGoT, ACoK, ASoS; Act II - AFfC, ADwD, Act III - TWoW, ADoS) there are many things that align. There are three major villains in the story, three major heroes, and these are represented by each of the three acts. Act I is about politics and war, Act II is about the aftermath of war and the inherent darkness of men, and Act III will most certainly be about magic, nature, gods and its relationship to humanity. If the plot wasn't enough to give this away, just take a look at the titles of the novels. Act I features thrones, kings, and swords - superficial objects and titles that represent politics and war and the game of thrones. Act II features crows and dragons - beasts, which for these portion of the novels, are actually a metaphor for the current state of humanity. Act III features winter and spring, represented by winds and dreams - magic and nature and its effect on humanity. The three major villains are perfect representations of these three acts and the themes represented by their villainy are actually pretty awesome when you consider where this story started, where it is now, and when it will most likely go in the future. Also, once you realize who the three main villains are, their obvious foils - the three prime protagonists in the story - become obvious.

**Tywin Lannister**
Tywin Lannister - Villain of Act I of a Song of Ice and Fire. He was the mastermind of the Red Wedding that decimated the Stark family and was the real power behind the Iron Throne. Many could argue that Joffrey was the primary villain of Act One with all his monstrous acts, but he was a puppet of the true power and a literal combination of the worst aspects of Tywin Lannister's own children. For all of the terrible deeds done by Tywin, he was still only a political foe. He knew love, he valued family, but when it came to politics and war he was absolutely ruthless and would do whatever it took to put his family on top - no matter the human cost. The political mastermind was eventually defeated by Tyrion Lannister, probably the only person more intelligent than Tywin and, as we'll continue to see in the story, the ultimate player in the game of thrones.

**Ramsay Bolton**
Ramsay Bolton - Villain of Act II. Ramsay represents the true evil in humanity that rose out of the ashes of war. Before Tywin died, he won the game of thrones, but in order to do so, he had to make alliances with terrible, despicable people. Tywin Lannister's death and the aftermath of the war of five kings left a feast for crows and Ramsay was the darkest crow of all. In a world where the political structure has been vastly interrupted and modified, power has been gained through false titles, and alliances are held together through tenuous handshakes and agreements, the true evil of humanity was able to rise completely unchecked. If Tywin represented the ultimate political villain in A Song of Ice and Fire, Ramsay represents the ultimate HUMAN villain. He is the epitome of the evil nature that humanity is capable of. He is cruel, sadistic, and has no regard at all to others around him. He is not even necessarily interested in power - at least in the ultimate sense - only the immediate selfish acknowledgement that he is more powerful than his almost equally awful father. The key to Ramsay is that he ENJOYS being cruel. A Song of Ice and Fire has many grey characters, but none so black as Ramsay. He represents human evil at the far end of the spectrum - as far as the spectrum can possibly go. It makes sense then, that only a true empathetic hero can and should be the downfall of Ramsay. The evidence that the Boltons are the bizarro Starks is nearly endless, and it makes sense that another Snow, Jon Snow - someone who has been painted as a True Hero - will defeat this human monster.

**Euron Grejoy**
Villain of Act III of a Song of Ice and Fire. Many believe that Euron's entrance this late in A Song of Ice and Fire is a little strange, but it actually makes perfect sense. If Tywin is political evil, Ramsay is human evil, then Euron, by the necessity of progressive storytelling, must represent divine evil. Ramsay was not allowed to be the prime representative of human evil until the political war was resolved. And likewise, Euron was not allowed to be the prime representative of an evil God until the evil of humanity had reached its apex. From the opening prologue of A Game of Thrones, it is clear that magic has come back into the world. We have seen this magic embraced by characters we know are more or less good and at the very least grey - Daenerys with dragons, Sam with dragon glass, all of the Starks with warging, Thoros with Beric, etc. But what happens if true evil embraces this newly reinstated magic? Well that is exactly what has been happening Euron for the duration of the novels. He has been mingling with Warlocks, procuring Dragon Eggs, sailing to Valyria, drinking Shade of the Evening, etc. His arrival in the Iron Islands in the second act of the story seems a little out of nowhere, but if you view Euron as a somewhat omniscient character, he has surveyed what has been happening in Westeros and realizes that the political structure has crumbled, the plight of the common person is at an all-time low, and narcissistically believes that as a God, no time is better than now to seize control. While the sadism of Ramsay was terrifying, Euron's sadism is exponentially more terrifying so due to the fact that he has transcended humanity. He is all-powerful. What is dead may never die, but rises again harder and stronger. In this case, Euron has risen as the Drowned God. Euron has entered the game late, but you could argue the same of another - 
one who perhaps may be on the same level as Euron, and potentially the bane of his existence - one who has risen from the ashes to birth dragons and in doing so - become a deity herself - Daenerys Targaryen, Mother of Dragons.

The natural progression of the story is driven by cause and effect. Men go to war and destroy everything. In the wake of destruction true human evil can flourish. Faced with the evil of humanity, men look to the Gods to be saved. The end is heading towards a showdown between humanity and nature and will be represented by the personified deities of Euron Greyjoy and Daenerys Targaryen.

I love these novels because there is always stuff to explore no matter how many times you've read it. The more thought you put into it, the more the complexities click in ways that are extremely pleasing. I just wanted to share these realizations I had with you all, and open it up for more discussion :)

**EDIT:** Thank you so much for your kind words! Many of you have brought up things that have expanded and further validated this line of thinking, which is awesome! Love this discussion, it's exactly what I wanted when I posted this!!

Also, many of you are saying the White Walkers should be viewed as the primary third act villain instead of Euron due to their divine evilness. I agree that the White Walkers are the primary antagonistic force in the series, and their full impact will be realized in the third act. However, the analysis I was intending to provide focuses primarily focuses on the human villains. The White Walkers are inherently evil and magical and all that and are the ultimate threat against mankind, but Euron is a *human* character that is embracing and through ambition embodying divine evilness against other men. He represents Martin's ultimate maxim in good narrative writing to a much larger scale - the human heart in conflict with itself. In this case the inherent evil and evil ambitions of men juxtaposed with those who are inherently good and and strive to make the world a better place. The White Walkers do not represent this because they are an outside force that we can not relate to. Martin has said that the White Walkers are not wholly black a la Sauron but that does not change the fact that they are foreign, magical, mysterious and completely unlike the human beings in the story. And again I'm only arguing for Euron as a primary villain (there are many villains, maybe even hundreds in this story) in the context of the narrative progression of inherent evil of humanity that is linked with the thematic development of the story and as a juxtaposition to our main protagonists. There are a lot of similarities between Euron and Daenerys that I think could benefit from further exploration :)"

In the following behind the scenes video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfXP1RHLLx4 , actor Kristian Nairn says that it was very in-character for Hodor to sacrifice himself for his friends. It seems to be a common interpretation of the scene. However it should be clear that the actual person we know as Hodor was cowering and confused, as you would reasonably expect someone with his disability to do in such a situation. ""Hodor"" only took action when Bran took over his body. It follows that Hodor did not sacrifice himself for Bran, but instead *Bran sacrificed Hodor for himself*. Bran not only was the cause of Hodor's disability, who then had him serve him throughout his life, to eventually sacrifice him in order to ensure his own survival. It's an incredibly dark story, and a parallel to the Lord/Vassal and Master/Slave relationships in the real world.

Tyrion is also one of the only people who knows that Littlefinger betrayed Ned. Episode Two also made a point of showing that Littlefinger is lying to Jon, telling him that he supported Ned and tried to protect him (and that Jon hates him). He told the same lie to Sansa a few seasons back.

I think Littlefinger is toast. Even if Jon wants to keep him alive to hold onto the Vale, Sansa learning about it would prompt her to reveal that he also killed Lysa, and his support would peal away.

Now go back and rewatch that scene, but pay very close attention to the score. It's two different songs transitioning into each other. These two songs are Rains of Castamere slowly turning into the stark theme 'Goodbye Brother.'

asoiaf,4klqi7,(Spoilers Extended) The books already told us who made the Others...,4233,5/23/2016 2:07,2016-22,895,"The Others are tied to two things via symbolism: the children of the forest, and weirwood trees. My favorite line is Cotter Pyke talking to Sam Tarly, incredulous at the tale of Sam slaying an Other:

>“Sam the Slayer!” he said, by way of greeting. “Are you sure you stabbed an Other, and not some child’s snow knight?” 

>This isn’t starting well. “It was the dragonglass that killed it, my lord,” Sam explained feebly.  (ASOS, Sam)

Some child's snow knight. That's what the Others are. Apparently, there's a rumor of this in Ironborn folklore:

>Asha saw only trees and shadows, the moonlit hills and the snowy peaks beyond. Then she realized that trees were creeping closer. “Oho,” she laughed, “these mountain goats have cloaked themselves in pine boughs.” The woods were on the move, creeping toward the castle like a slow green tide. She thought back to a tale she had heard as a child, about the children of the forest and their battles with the First Men, when the greenseers turned the trees to warriors.  (ADWD, The Wayward Bride)

Trees as warriors is an idea we see all over the place in the books, with my favorite being Jon Snow perceiving the trees as warriors waiting to storm the Fist of the Fist Men right before the Fist is attacked by wights and probably Others:

>The trees stood beneath him, warriors armored in bark and leaf, deployed in their silent ranks awaiting the command to storm the hill. Black, they seemed … it was only when his torchlight brushed against them that Jon glimpsed a flash of green. (ACOK, Jon)

And again, this is right before the Others launch their wight attack on the Fist. 

The Others also have a tree-related nickname which isn't used as often:

>The horn blew thrice long, three long blasts means Others. The white walkers of the wood, the cold shadows, the monsters of the tales that made him squeak and tremble as a boy, riding their giant ice-spiders, hungry for blood …

White Walkers *of the Wood.*

The term ""white shadow"" or ""pale shadow"" is used to describe the Others many times in the books, including twice in the prologue of AGOT. Interestingly, there's one occasion when a weirwood is described as a pale shadow, just like an Other, and it happens when a tree is frozen in ice:

>Outside, the night was white as death; pale thin clouds danced attendance on a silver moon, while a thousand stars watched coldly. He could see the humped shapes of other huts buried beneath drifts of snow, and beyond them the pale shadow of a weirwood armored in ice. (ADWD, Prologue)

Dany's dream of slaying Others on dragon back at the Trident involves warriors armored in ice, which everyone takes for the Others. So a tree which is a pale shadow and armored in ice has two references to the Others, who wear ice armor. 

The Others' bones are pale and shiny like milkglass, and their flesh milky white; while their swords shine with faint moonlight:

>The Other slid forward on silent feet. In its hand was a longsword like none that Will had ever seen. No human metal had gone into the forging of that blade. It was **alive with moonlight,** translucent, a shard of crystal so thin that it seemed almost to vanish when seen edge- on. There was a **faint blue shimmer** to the thing, a **ghost- light** that played around its edges, and somehow Will knew it was sharper than any razor. (AGOT, prologue)

>The Other slid gracefully from the saddle to stand upon the snow. Sword-slim it was, and milky white. (ASOS, Sam)

Milk and moonlight and a faint glow - these things are associated with the Others... and the weirwood face known as the Black Gate:

>It was white weirwood, and there was a face on it. 

>A glow came from the wood, like **milk and moonlight,** so faint it scarcely seemed to touch anything beyond the door itself, not even Sam standing right before it. The face was old and pale, wrinkled and shrunken. It looks dead. Its mouth was closed, and its eyes; its cheeks were sunken, its brow withered, its chin sagging. If a man could live for a thousand years and never die but just grow older, his face might come to look like that.

The Others are also known as the ""white walkers of the wood""

And finally, we have the prologue of AGOT, which basically spells out the whole thing, with repeated anthropomorphizations of the trees as being antagonistic to the Night's Watch (way mar in particular) right before the confrontation with the Others:

>Down below, the lordling called out suddenly, “Who goes there?” Will heard uncertainty in the challenge. He stopped climbing; he listened; he watched. **The woods gave answer:** the rustle of leaves, the icy rush of the stream, a distant hoot of a snow owl. 
>The Others made no sound. 
>Will saw movement from the corner of his eye. **Pale shapes gliding through the wood.** He turned his head, glimpsed a **white shadow** in the darkness. Then it was gone. **Branches stirred** gently in the wind, **scratching at one another with wooden fingers.**

Right after the shadows come through the wood, the tree is portray as humanoid with its clutching fingers. Lots more of this all through the scene:

>Behind him, he heard the soft metallic slither of the lordling’s ringmail, the rustle of leaves, and muttered curses as **reaching branches grabbed at his longsword and tugged on his splendid sable cloak.**

I won't quote all of them - just re-read the prologue and think about the trees as symbols for tree warriors who become Others.

In the show scene, we have a person up agains the weirwood when they are transformed by insertion of the black stone.  What the show did not touch on is what role the Weirwood really plays in Other creation - I'm talking book canon here. I suspect it has to be a skinchanger or greenseer who is transformed, perhaps a greenseer bonded to a tree.  The Other would then be a kind of ghost of the tree / greenseer union.

As for the black stone which transformed the victim, and the black obelisks surrounding that tree, I believe those are oily black stones, and in turn, I believe the oily black stone to be moon meteors from the second moon which exploded in the Dawn Age.  I have theorized that these black moon meteors can be used to work dark magic - I have a [wordpress blog](https://lucifermeanslightbringer.wordpress.com) and a [podcast](http://lucifermeanslightbringer.podomatic.com), actually, called the Mythical Astronomy of Ice and Fire - and I even postulated that these black meteors may have been used to make the Others. I can't help but think the black stone which created the Other in the show is reference to this idea. 

P.S. My buddy Voice of the First Men has an amazing theory about Dawn being Ice and the Others coming from weirwoods which I highly recommend:

##Why Bran Won’t Show Us R+L=J

**************************

&nbsp;


The show has already teased the Tower of Joy. When Bran attempts to enter, he’s stopped by Bloodraven and told [“*That’s enough for one day. We will visit again another time.*”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDOWgbo1ho8)

&nbsp;


However the [trailer for the next episode, “The Door” seems to imply that Bran comes into contact with the Night’s King in a vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcqxfGAaRhE). We know from the March Madness trailer that the Night’s King [actually grabs Bran’s arm.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKrhgVFTI6I)

&nbsp;


Also, from a [behind the scenes video on the prosthetics used in season 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOyrpGRdEzg), we are led to believe that [the Others descend on the cave of the Three Eyed Raven.](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/03/game-of-thrones-battle-nights-king-bran-cave)

&nbsp;


**I believe that this siege happens in the next episode, and that Bran will not be the one to see the inside of the Tower of Joy**. This episode is [the point at which he leaves the cave](http://www.ew.com/sites/default/files/i/2015/12/28/got-game-of-thrones-9999z-2015-122815-07a.jpg), perhaps to venture further north to those standing stones and dying weirwood tree from his vision. It’s even possible that Bloodraven dies, and Bran has to go on alone with his only limited knowledge.

&nbsp;


So if not through Bran, how will we learn more about the Tower of Joy?

&nbsp;



##The Stranger Knows Nothing

**************************

&nbsp;


One of the [most famous lines from the show and books is ^(^NSFW ^Link, ^Cave ^Scene) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLisM2KPDIA):

&nbsp;


>You know nothing, Jon Snow.

&nbsp;


However the concept of nothingness comes up in other instances as well. Arya [tells the dying farmer that “Nothing could be worse than this”](https://youtu.be/5LOLw1w48Kk?t=1m46s), and he replies “Maybe nothing *is* worse than this”. Notably, the idea of death being nothingness has been confirmed by both [Beric Dondarrion](https://youtu.be/GhOVUl1OzSs?t=3m55s) and recently [Jon Snow](https://youtu.be/RhrkhAM0Gwk?t=1m49s), some of the only characters who would know.

&nbsp;


>*Melisandre*: You’ve been to the other side?

>*Beric*: The other side? There is no other side. I have been to the darkness, my lady.

-

> *Melisandre*: Afterwards - after they stabbed you, after you died, where did you go? What did you see?

> *Jon*: Nothing. There was nothing at all.

&nbsp;


And now, in the last episode, [we are told another story about nothingness](https://youtu.be/BCjL8YpndzQ?t=2m6s), which I have not yet seen connected to the accounts of the afterlife from Jon Snow and Beric.

&nbsp;


>*Margaery*: And one day **you walked through a graveyard, and realized it was all for nothing**, and set out on the path to righteousness. Book of the Stranger: verse twenty-five. 

&nbsp;


1. In a metaphorical sense, both Jon and Beric have walked through a graveyard and realized it’s all for nothing. They are now closely associated with the Stranger as well, who is the aspect for death.
2. As for setting out on the path to righteousness, I believe that Jon’s experience and new appreciation of life and death is definitely setting him on a different path, which Kit Harington comments on below. 
3. In this sense, “You know nothing, Jon Snow” was never about Jon knowing or learning something, it was about him one day understanding nothing, or rather understanding death.


&nbsp;


Kit Harington [comments in this EW article on the conversation between him and Melisandre](http://www.ew.com/article/2016/05/05/game-of-thrones-kit-harington-jon-snow-ew-cover):

&nbsp;


>He needs to change. There’s a brilliant line when Melisandre asks: “What did you see?” And he says: “Nothing, there was nothing at all.” That cuts right to our deepest fear, that there’s nothing after death. **And that’s the most important line in the whole season for me**. Jon’s never been afraid of death, and that’s made him a strong and honorable person. He realizes something about his life now: He has to live it, because that’s all there is. He’s been over the line and there’s nothing there. And that changes him. It literally puts the fear of God into him. He doesn’t want to die ever again. But if he does, he doesn’t want to be brought back.

&nbsp;


**I feel like the story of the Stranger walking through a graveyard with the understanding of death could perhaps tie in literally to Jon’s story very soon.**

&nbsp;



##Jon Snow’s Nightmares

**************************

&nbsp;


Jon has dreamt recurring dreams of the crypts beneath Winterfell since he left home. Many people assume that there is something hidden there, and I believe rightfully so.

&nbsp;


>And then I find myself in front of the door to the crypts. It's black inside, and I can see the steps spiraling down. **Somehow I know I have to go down there, but I don't want to. I'm afraid of what might be waiting for me**. The old Kings of Winter are down there, sitting on their thrones with stone wolves at their feet and iron swords across their laps, but it's not them I'm afraid of. I scream that I'm not a Stark, that this isn't my place, but it's no good, I have to go anyway, so I start down, feeling the walls as I descend, with no torch to light the way. It gets darker and darker, until I want to scream."" He stopped, frowning, embarrassed. ""That's when I always wake."" 

>*A Game of Thrones - Jon IV*

&nbsp;


We know that Ned has his empty tomb already prepared before his death. Bran and Rickon go down to see it just before receiving the news of his beheading.

&nbsp;


>When Bran looked up, his little brother was standing in the mouth of Father's tomb. … ""You let my father be,"" Rickon warned Luwin. ""You let him be.""

>""Rickon,"" Bran said softly. ""Father's not here.""

>*A Game of Thrones - Bran VII*

&nbsp;


In fact, we are told that there are numerous empty, unsealed tombs prepared for not only for Ned, but also for his children.

&nbsp;


>Ned stopped at last and lifted the oil lantern. The crypt continued on into darkness ahead of them, but **beyond this point the tombs were empty and unsealed; black holes waiting for their dead, waiting for him and his children**. Ned did not like to think on that. 

>*A Game of Thrones - Eddard I*

&nbsp;


We are led to believe that the crypts are somewhat selective: Kings of Winter and Lords of Winterfell receive statues of their likeness, though an exception was made for Lyanna and Brandon. It’s possible that **Jon Snow, being a bastard, would sadly not have a place reserved for him in the Stark crypts**, but would be buried rather in the lichyard with the servants.

&nbsp;


>Beneath the shadow of the First Keep was an ancient lichyard, its headstones spotted with pale lichen, **where the old Kings of Winter had laid their faithful servants**. It was there they buried Lady, while her brothers stalked between the graves like restless shadows. She had gone south, and only her bones had returned.

>*A Game of Thrones - Bran VI*

&nbsp;


Interestingly, we also know that there is a substantial part of the crypt that is inaccessible due to a cave in. 

&nbsp;


>""The steps go farther down,"" observed Lady Dustin.

>""**There are lower levels. Older. The lowest level is partly collapsed, I hear. I have never been down there.**"" He pushed the door open and led them out into a long vaulted tunnel, where mighty granite pillars marched two by two into blackness.

>*A Dance with Dragons - The Turncloak*

&nbsp;


We are told that despite Old Nan’s warnings that there were “spiders down here, and rats as big as dogs”, the Stark children often played in the crypts. It seems unlikely that the children would have either been able to or have wanted to play in the lower collapsed levels.

&nbsp;


>Bran could not recall the last time he had been in the crypts. It had been before, for certain. When he was little, he used to play down here with Robb and Jon and his sisters.

>*A Game of Thrones - Bran VII*

&nbsp;


It’s also suggested that Jon’s dreams have him going very deep into the crypt, down the spiraling stairs with no torch to light the way, perhaps into places he had never been before. **I believe that his dreams are leading him to some truth hidden in the lower collapsed levels of the Winterfell crypt.**

&nbsp;


##Legends: In Universe and Out

**************************

&nbsp;


[The Legend of Bael the Bard](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bael_the_Bard)

&nbsp;


*A baby kept hidden in the Winterfell crypts*

&nbsp;


>**Bael the Bard was a King-Beyond-the-Wall**. According to legend, he was one of the greatest free folk raiders of his time, a man who outwitted the northmen and **managed to impregnate Lord Brandon Stark's daughter. … The Stark line was on the verge of extinction**, when one day the girl was back in her room, holding in her hand an infant: **they had actually never left Winterfell, staying hidden in the crypts**. Bael's bastard with the daughter of the Lord Stark became the new Lord Stark.

&nbsp;


Parallels to R+L=J - 

- A king/prince stealing away the daughter of Winterfell
- The Stark/Targaryen line being on the verge of extinction
- The product of this union being hidden away in the Winterfell crypts

&nbsp;


[The Testimony of Mushroom](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/The_Testimony_of_Mushroom)

&nbsp;


*Dragon eggs in the depths of the crypts*

&nbsp;


>The Testimony of Mushroom alleges that when Prince Jacaerys Velaryon came to Winterfell at the start of the Dance of the Dragons, **Vermax laid dragon eggs in the depths of the crypts**, where hot springs are near the walls.

&nbsp;


Parallels to R+L=J - 

- Dragons/Targaryens being hidden in the Winterfell crypts

&nbsp;


[Sir Lancelot](http://nightbringer.se/a_joyousgarde.html) at [The Joyous Keep](http://www.pantheon.org/articles/j/joyous_gard.html)

&nbsp;


*Lancelot discovers he’s a secret prince in a tomb at “The Joyous Keep”*

&nbsp;


> Sir Lancelot is orphaned as a baby, and raised by the lady of the lake. He becomes a knight to King Arthur, and conquers a keep called the Dolorous Gard where Queen Guinevere is being held. He renames it the Joyous Gard. In the graveyard is a tomb covered by a giant jeweled metal slab, engraved to indicate that only the man who conquers the keep will be able to lift it. He lifts the tomb’s slab with ease, and **beneath it is written “Here will lie Lancelot of the Lake, the Son of King Ban.” He thus learns he is a prince inside a grave.**

&nbsp;


Parallels to R+L=J - 


- An orphaned baby boy raised under an assumed identity
- Obvious similarities between “Joyous Gard/Joyous Keep” and “The Tower of Joy”
- “Dolorous Gard” (an unusual adjective) and “Dolorous Edd” 
- The identity of the last of a royal line being revealed in a crypt
- A similar renaming in-universe from [the Palace of Sorrow to the Palace of Love](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Palace_of_Sorrow)

&nbsp;


[Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone](http://www.heroofcamelot.com/legend/sword-in-the-stone)

&nbsp;


*Whoso Pulleth Out This Sword of this Stone and Anvil, is Rightwise King Born of all England.*

&nbsp;


>In Robert de Boron's Merlin, Arthur obtained the British throne by pulling a sword from a stone. … In this account, the act could not be performed except by ""the true king,"" meaning the divinely appointed king or true heir of Uther Pendragon.

- The son of the King raised as the bastard son of an Ally to the crown
- Similarity between “waking dragons from stone” and “pulling sword from stone”
- This “stone” action reveals the true heir

&nbsp;



##What’s in the Crypts?

**************************

&nbsp;


If, at the end of the war, an exception was made for Brandon and Lyanna to have a place a prestige in the crypts,could perhaps another exception have been made and gone unnoticed?

&nbsp;


**I believe that a tomb was prepared for Jon in the Winterfell crypts, hidden away in the lower levels. This is going against strict tradition and historical observance that the Crypts are for trueborn Starks only.** When Rickon just shows Ned’s grave to the Frey boys, Bran is very upset with him.

&nbsp;


>Rickon even showed them the deep vaults under the earth where the stonemason was carving father's tomb. **""You had no right!"" Bran screamed at his brother when he heard. ""That was our place, a Stark place!""** But Rickon never cared.

>*A Clash of Kings - Bran I*

&nbsp;


We can even get a hint of this wrongful inclusion in the crypts from Jon himself: His dreams revolve around the idea of him not belonging in the crypts, not having a place there. This is perhaps because a place has *already* been prepared for him there.

&nbsp;


>Their grey granite eyes turned to follow him as he passed, and their grey granite fingers tightened on the hilts of the rusted swords upon their laps. **You are no Stark, he could hear them mutter, in heavy granite voices. There is no place for you here. Go away.** He walked deeper into the darkness. … Up above he heard drums. They are feasting in the Great Hall, but **I am not welcome there. I am no Stark, and this is not my place.** His crutch slipped and he fell to his knees.

>*A Storm of Swords - Jon VIII*

&nbsp;


The only other person to have similar foreboding dreams of the Winterfell crypts is Ned, who would have been the one who made the decision to break tradition and include a place for Jon.

&nbsp;


>He was walking through the crypts beneath Winterfell, as he had walked a thousand times before. **The Kings of Winter watched him pass with eyes of ice, and the direwolves at their feet turned their great stone heads and snarled**. Last of all, he came to the tomb where his father slept, with Brandon and Lyanna beside him. ""Promise me, Ned,"" Lyanna's statue whispered. She wore a garland of pale blue roses, and her eyes wept blood.

>*A Game of Thrones - Eddard XIII*

&nbsp;


Quick recap of the reasons why Jon’s prepared tomb is the secret in the Crypts, before I get into how it will play out:

- Jon’s nightmares are leading him into the depths of the crypts, into the closed off area beyond the collapse
- Ned also has nightmares of the crypts, leading us to believe he has angered the Old Kings of Winter somehow, and that this is likely related to Jon
- We know that there are tombs reserved in the crypt for the Stark children, of which Bastard Jon probably wouldn’t and shouldn’t have a place
- Jon’s recurring dreams telling him “There is no place for you here” leads me to believe that they are angry that a place has *already* been allotted for him

&nbsp;


So the nightmares of the Old Kings of Winter can be attributed to their anger that Jon Snow was given a place among them in the crypts. **So how is this related to R+L=J?**

&nbsp;


##How and When The Reveal Will Happen

**************************

&nbsp;


**WHEN**

&nbsp;


If Jon,( ^(like Lancelot before him - see legends above) ) is going to discover his true parentage inscribed in a tomb, then it can only take place *after* he retakes Winterfell, so **episode 9 or 10 of season six**. It would be the cliffhanger leading into season seven. 

&nbsp;


**HOW**

&nbsp;


>*Jon, upon retaking Winterfell, decides to go down into the crypts to visit Eddard’s grave, but finds that Ned’s bones haven’t come to Winterfell yet. He instead passes by the future resting places of his siblings:*

&nbsp;


>*His finds his way is blocked by rocks and rubble from the collapse. He considers going back, but something catches his eye beyond the obstruction. He begins pulling at stones, and sees another tomb, prepared and empty.*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;



##CONCLUSION

**************************

&nbsp;



**QUESTION: When would Ned Stark have thought it safe for the truth of Jon’s parentage to be known?**

&nbsp;


**ANSWER:** **Never**. **As long as Jon is living, him being a Targaryen puts his life in danger**. **That is why the secret is kept hidden in Jon’s own grave.**

*Ned ensured that, at least in death, Jon Snow could assume his rightful identity.*

&nbsp;

**********************************************


&nbsp;


&nbsp;


&nbsp;


&nbsp;


EDIT: Some extra thoughts after posting:

- I believe that Ned did expect to die before Jon, and that he left some sort of clue that is hidden in his grave to indicate for his heir (Robb) to go down to the lower levels. That is why Ned hasn't been buried yet: Burying Ned means finding this clue, so that his heir could continue to hold the secret safe. 

- When Ned is killed, Bran and Rickon both dream of him in the crypts, sad, saying something about Jon.

- We already know of other stonemasons being silenced: Those that built the red keep were murdered for what they knew. I certainly don't mean to suggest that Ned killed the man who made Jon's headstone, just to point out that this isn't the first time that we've been introduced to the idea of stonemasons knowing secrets. EDIT: As u/heysuphey noted: Tywin Lannister, Season Two: ""**He was a well-read stonemason? Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.**"" So a stonemason might inscribe the words, but have no idea of their meaning.

- This could have to do with Hodor: If the lower levels were collapsed on purpose, it's possible that Hodor was asked to help, as he was big and strong. There could have been an accident which left him with a head injury. We know that at a certain point, Hodor was terrified of entering the crypts. "

asoiaf,6s5849,[Spoilers Extended]Jaime's Charge...,4196,8/7/2017 12:34,2017-32,1444,"Is one of the best moments of the entire show. At first it just seems like a frantic charge - a call back to Jon's wild dash last season. Though when you think of the dynamics at play, it's one of most emotional, dramatic, intense and conflicting moments of the show so far.

This battle is all we have ever wanted. Dany finally fighting in Westeros. A dragon decimating armies. The Dothraki in an open field. The Lannister armies getting destroyed. Yet it was completely bittersweet.

We are made to root for Dany against crazy Queen Cersei, but yet we see Jaime and Bronn on the other side. Jaime who completely won everyone over in Season 3, when it was revealed he is an honourable and just Knight, who's hate hated for saving thousands of lives. While not as built on in the books, he has had quite the transformation and shows a considerable amount of honour and respect (even to his enemies). Then we have Bronn, everyone's favourite happy go lucky sellsword. Even still, we should feel thrilled that the Lannisters are finally getting their just desserts, but that Arya scene showed us that the foot soldiers are just everyday folk fighting someone else's war. They have families, hopes and dreams; they're scared and they're getting slaughtered. The one scene where that guy is shaking as the Dothraki approach just epitomes this.

We then see Tyrion, visibly horrified seeing his own house's men getting slaughtered. We also see Jaime throughout the entire battle watching his army get burned alive and brutalised. Then Drogon gets shot and now we're straight back to Dany's side. These dragons we've grown so attached to. Jaime sees Dany and her 'weapon' that is burning everyone alive. All Jaime can see is the Mad King's daughter. The very thing he tried to stop is happening and you can see the anger brewing in his face.

Cut to the charge. Jaime knows he can end the war then and there by killing Dany in a call back to him killing the Mad King. He's not thinking straight. Tyrion takes on the role of the viewer; he's literally us. Watching someone he's very attached to charging at someone else he's very attached to. The music and the cinematography was absolutely spot on. It was gripping and so hard to watch. I didn't want Jaime to die, yet he's charging at Dany and Drogon. So many conflicting emotions during that charge. It was absolutely fantastic. Kudos to the director for giving us one of the best moments on the show.

For many years we all speculated whether Jon and Dany would meet up and get it on in later stages of the story. Well, this Sunday it happened. Seems to safe to assume that this is something we'll see in the books as well because as the two main Classic Heroes of the story, both of whom are hot, it seemed likely enough, even before all the eye-fucking they did in the lead up to this season's finale. 

Of course, last season, R+L = J was CONFIRMED^TM and this season it was double super-confirmed (Hey Rhaegar!) right, in fact, as they were looking into each other's eyes, about to get their half-unwitting royal fuck on. In classic Targaryen fashion, approximately 31 seconds after they are shown in bed together, Jon Snow a.k.a. Aegon of House Targaryen, the Sixth of His Name, King of the Andals, and the Rhoynar, and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm, blew his load into his aunt. 

**Coefficients of Relationship**

Now, the genetics of incest and the related mathematics is something that I weirdly know something about (it has to do with some science fiction writing I have been working on, and my university studies). There is a mathematical method to calculate just how incestuous a pairing is - it is called “Coefficient of Relationship""  denoted *r*. 

Essentially what you do is map out a genetic pedigree that includes all the common ancestors of two people who are proposed to hook up. There is one link between each parent and each offspring. From there you identify each path in this network from one partner in the hookup to the other through the map of the pedigree that does not include any ancestor more than once or do any backtracking. Count the number of links in each path, and assign a number 2^-n to each path, where *n* is the number of links. The sum of each of these numbers for each path is your coefficient **r**, which can be anywhere from 0 (not incestuous) to 1 (ridiculously incestuous). 

**Skim the following if you are not interested in the mathematical or genetic details.** 

Many genes can be described as having a dominant (T) and recessive (t) allele for a particular trait. For any particular gene you may have two dominant (TT), two recessive (tt), or one dominant and one recessive (Tt). The recessive traits express only when both alleles are recessive (tt). Otherwise (TT or Tt), the dominant trait will express. (This is glossing over lots of details that aren't important to this discussion). When you have either TT or tt, this is known as having a gene that is *homozygous*. If they are different - Tt - then it is called *heterozygous*. When your body makes sperm or egg cells, it splits every gene in half at random. Your sperm or egg will meet with an egg or sperm that has a random other half of each gene to make a new genome.

A specimen that is breeding with random members of the population that are unrelated to them will, on average, have a genome that is 50% homozygous (with 25% being TT and the other 25% being tt) and 50% heterozygous. But a highly inbred specimen will on average have a higher proportion of homozygosity in recessive traits because its ancestors were reproducing too often with family members, who are more likely to have the same alleles. For example, [this diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbreeding_depression#/media/File:Shetland_pony_inbred.jpg). 

Incest is bad, as you can see in the diagram, because those recessive alleles are more likely to express because there is more homozygosity (tt). That means the bad recessive traits from your ancestors that would have been hidden in a heterozygous (Tt) pair are going to start showing up more often in homozygous pairs. (This isn't a problem for dominant traits because dominant traits are more likely to be beneficial since they are the ones expressing most often. If dominant traits were the shitty ones, offspring would be much less fit overall. I think.)

Long story short there exists something called coefficient of inbreeding that exists for any individual with a known breeding history, and when you add up the coefficients of inbreeding in a particular fashion along the path from one partner to another, you can get the coefficient of relationship.

**Stop skimming here to see the point of coefficient of relationship.**

To give a sense of what the coefficient of relationship  *r* actually means, look at this[ chart:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_relationship#Human_relationships)

The higher the coefficient of relationship, the ickier the pairing. The more distant the relationship, the fewer the common ancestors, the smaller the coefficient and the less gross it is. 

A parent-child pairing, as well as a brother-sister pairing, have a coefficient of *r* = 0.50, or 50%. Grandparent/grandchild and Aunt/uncle - nephew/niece have a 25% coefficient - that’s the minimum *r* that Jon and Dany could have, by the way. Actually, it is higher than that because their ancestors themselves were inbred, as we will see.

Coefficients of 25% and above will be often be considered illegal and/or abusive (don't fuck your kids!), or at the very least will probably be met with a high level of disgust by most. Between 25% and 12.5% I believe is usually not outlawed but still considered gross. Going down to 3.13% (somewhere between a first cousin and a second cousin), I’d say is still within substantial weirding-people-out territory (depending on what state you live in maybe?). Hooking up with a third cousin or someone of a more distant relationship (0.78% and below) might make you the victim of some furrowed brows or wisecracks, but probably not otherwise considered that big of a deal. 

**Jon and Dany’s Pedigree**

I drew the pedigree, but didn't draw the whole family tree. Anyone who is not a direct ancestor of both Jon and Dany is omitted. The greyed out people are also those people for whom there is no path from Jon to Dany that could go through them without backtracking. I assumed anyone who is not a Targaryen and anyone who is not named has no Targaryen ancestors for simplicity (although considering how much sister- and brother-fucking the Targaryens do, maybe that's not a safe assumption). None of these people will affect the calculation.

[Here it is, all the way back to Aenar Targaryen, Dany’s 18x-great-grandfather, and Jon’s 19x-great-grandfather.] (http://i.imgur.com/OLQp0px.png)

Wow. Marriage really was a family affair with these Targs. Look how many brother-sister pairings are in there! Gross! (As an aside, I also calculated coefficient of inbreeding for all these Targaryens and it's really, really high.  That's what the ""f=0.4146"" means next to Viserys II. This post is long as hell already, so I'll save that for another time.).

Now it turns out most of this was not necessary to draw because remember, we are only going to count along paths that lead from Jon to Dany without any backtracking (and that go only back in time to the earliest generation in the path from Jon and forward in time to Dany). If you look at Aegon V, there is no way to go farther back on any path from Jon to Dany that doesn't backtrack over Aegon V. But I drew this whole thing before I realized that, and in any case, it's interesting to look at. 

So, let's identify all the paths from Jon to Dany, and we count the number of links (denoted > here in the text), and assign 2^-n for where n is the number of links. We have:

2 3-link paths, or 2 * 2^-3:

* Jon > Rhaegar > Aerys II > Dany

**Coefficient of relationship *r* = 2 (2^-3) +  4 (2^-5) + 8 (2^-7) = 0.4375.**

So, Jon and Dany hooking up is actually significantly worse than an aunt and nephew ""normally"" hooking up, which would be ""only"" *r* = 25%. About the same is as if one were to fuck one's half-sibling. But due to the several generations of inbreeding in the immediately previous generations, Jon and Dany's level of inbreeding comes in at 43.75%, which is much closer to something like a brother and sister having sex, which is 50%.  

Now, if you are like me, where you were actually shipping these two because you always want the hot heroes to hook up and/or because the dramatic irony is just too delicious to pass up and it is such a GRRM type thing to happen, you may be feeling weird and wondering what kind of sicko you may be. 

But, really, think about Jaime and Cersei. At first that was weird, but it's been what, five to seven years in the books, seven years in the real world the show has been going, and like twenty years IRL for the books that we have been seeing Jaime and Cersei bang and they've had kids and everything. It was shocking at first but now we don't even bat an eyelash watching Cersei get up out of the bed naked with Jaime this season, and here she is pregnant with a fourth kid by him (supposedly...I like others question this somewhat). They've been at this so long and are both attractive enough that I actually have to remind myself that it's incest, and that really, I should theoretically be more disgusted. But at this point, meh. To me it's more of a political curiosity in terms of how the people of Westeros will respond than it is of any moral concern for me. And Jaime and Cersei have a coefficient of [edit: at least] 50% by virtue of being brother and sister (and it was pointed out to me that their parents were cousins so, that will make it even higher), so that is *more* incestuous than Jon and Dany (though not by much). 

**Moral of the story: However much you care about Jaime and Cersei fucking each other as brother and sister, then you should care about Jon and Dany fucking each other somewhat less. ~~Exactly~~ At least ~~8.75%~~  12.5% less, actually.**  

Edit: A couple responses to comments:

1. I guess it would be kind of silly to say I didn't mean to offend people who are the product of incest (which is everyone if you go far back enough), since I'm talking about how gross it is. It wasn't supposed to be mean but I guess it could be taken that way. Sorry. But I actually don't care about consenting adults having sex with each other, even if their kids might be messed up. Having healthy kids is not a requirement for anyone else who wants to have sex so it makes no sense to impose it on incest...uh...people. In any case inbreeding is usually not a problem unless it is repeated over multiple generations. But it's true that there is a fairly universal gross out reaction if the relationship is close, one that I think its hard to argue is totally unjustified. So...yeah.

2. Several people pointed out the [Westermarck Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westermarck_effect) which I ignored/glossed over on purpose and also forgot that it had a specific name.

3. Some other calculation I did of how inbred the other Targaryens in that tree are showed that the Targaryens in real life probably would have died out a long time ago by dying super early, having numerous stillbirths, or just being totally infertile with all the brother-sister mating they were doing. The only negative effect they seem to suffer is occasionally being a little loopy. So, yes, some of you are correct that genetics doesn't work in the series like it does in real life.

4. ""Sharing genetic material"" is not quite the right way to express the problem with inbreeding. All humans are nearly identical genetically when you consider the genome as a whole. So the issue is that when you breed with a family member the relative distribution of homozygosity and heterozygosity is thrown off balance, not that the two parents ""share genes"". What they share is a higher likelihood of matching up the same alleles for a given gene. My understanding is that this is why when a highly inbred person mates with someone outside their family, it nullifies the effect of previous generations of inbreeding. There is no relationship between the respective homo-/heterozygous distributions of each partner, so the offspring will on average have the same distribution as a pair of random mates."

After all of this time, Beanie's Ned is still, in my mind, the face and embodiment of the entire GoT series. He absolutely nailed the role of Ned. It's a shame because if Ned were still alive, or Beanie was playing another role, the show would probably be on another level.

Here's to hoping we see him come back for some flashbacks.

And an honorable mention to all of the great actors we lost as well in S1. Mark Addy, Jason Momoa, and Harry Lloyd. (and RIP fat stable boy. gone too soon. died too young. RIP in pieces)"
asoiaf,35tgxl,(All Spoilers) Jorah the Explorah show-only super-tinfoil.,4007,5/13/2015 11:08,2015-20,659,"After watching S5E5, it seems pretty obvious that J-Bear is taking over JonCon's role as Greyscale patient zero.

But what if there's more to this? What if Jorah isn't just absorbing the role of one character, but multiple characters. What if D&D are using him to cut the Meereenese Knot?

Think about it. Jorah & Tyrion are currently somewhere in or near the ruins of Valyria after escaping from the Stone Men. (Since the Rhoyne has been replaced with Valyria in the show). And we know for a fact that Euron finds Dragonbinder, or atleast claims to, in the ruins of Valyria. Who knows, our dynamic duo may stumble upon the horn and decide to take it with them?

Furthermore, it seems likely that they will get captured by pirates, the same way as the book. Jorah will get beaten up mercilessly, Tyrion will be in chains, yada yada. But what if, the ship has a certain Red Priest? A red priest who sees Jorah's greyscale and decides to treat it with fire magic. Thus, providing him with RED HAND OF SMOKY DOOM! Cue screams of ecstacy from Ajorah Ahai supporters.

Jorah has Dragonbinder and red smoking hand of doom.
Jorah is Victarion.

Proceed further to Meereen. Jorah enters as an enslaved pit-fighter. He fights and Sons of harpies attack, etc etc, and then suddenly Drogon! Jorah calls out to him trying to protect dany, ""Try me! Over here!"". But eventually Dany tames Drogon and escapes on his back. Now its all upto Jorah to handle shit in that godforsaken place. He confronts Hizdahr mo kravitz, and asks him if he's the harpy. Hiz calls for backup from Khrazz/Malko/Pitfighter extra #3. 

""I'll eat your heart, Hairy man.""
""Then come.""

Jorah is Barristan.

Later Jorah, Grey worm & Tyrion decide to go down to the catacombs. Cause they want to release the dragons. Why? For convoluted show-written reasons mmkay?.

Needless to say, it does not end well. Tyrion & GW manage to escape, but what about poor Jorah the Explorah?

""Oh.""

TL;DR: Jorah is Cell from dragonballz. He's gonna be absorbing Jon Connington, Victarion, Barristan, Quentyn and probably Moonboy for all I know. 

Edit: Thank you kind ser for my very first reddit gold!

Also, fixed some sentence structuring that may have made people think Jorah was taking over Drogon's role as well. "

What a fucking BADASS.  I love all them crows up in CASS' BLACK, but JON is THE SHIT.  LET ME LAY IT DOWN ONCE OVER.  Not counting BANGING YGRITTE within a couple days of knowing her, getting shot with not one, two, but THREE fucking ARROWS, BURNIN' CRASTERS KEEP LIKE A BOSS and invert deep-throatin that Raphael fuck with VALYRIAN STEEL, this dude FUCKED SHIT UP LAST NIGHT!!!


Other than making Thorne passively aggressively apologize for not listening to his TURN-TURNCLOAK WISDOM, and chewin Slynt a new fucking asshole to supplement the first one on his face, dude took that wall, and BLEW UP FUCKING MAMMOTHS.  ONCE AGAIN,
HE MADE A MAMMOTH RUN THE FUCK AWAY!!! A MAMMOTH.


He was so fucking legit he basically told Grenn to kill a fucking giant for him, and the dude KILLED A FUCKING GIANT!!!!!  THATS HOW POWERFUL THOSE BEAUTIFUL BLACK EYES ARE!


Then, when he realizes killing those woodsy fucks climbin the wall is child's play, dude decides to go downstairs to wet his fucking steel.  He didn't even wait for the fucking elevator to stop before he JUMP ROLLED off that shit into slicing open some wildling pie.


Then proceeding to FUCKING OWN every raccoon wearing bitch in his way, sends his boy to get his fucking DIREWOLF out the cage, to feed him FUCKING DINNER!!!!


Then the cannibal Thenn that looks like he just exited the gathering of the juggalos takes notice of Jon fucking shit up, decides to try his luck.  WRONG FUCKING MOVE BRO.


Starting off with his sword vs axe fight, Jon loses his grip on the sword.  ""Hey, shit happens, I don't have a sword, ILL take A FUCKING CHAIN, NEXT BEST THING AMIRITE!?""  Then he plays fucking cats cradle on silver surfers' battle axe, knocks that shit out the race straight gangster style.  


What? ANVIL TO THE FACE? Okay.  THROWN THROUGH A FIRE?! Alright...CHOKE ME UP AGAINST A WALL? Cool.  My turn...PLAYTIMES OVER FUCKHEAD!  ITS FUCKING HAMMER TIME!  BAM! 


Dude turns around, sees his ginger minge checking him out, with an arrow cocked at him.  Just fucking smiles, no worries.  Until homeboy bobby Fischer of kiddy-archery shoots a hole in one in his girls chest, damn.  Olly, bummer dude, how you gonna treat a brother like that?  She did kill your dad but what the fuck? That's J-Sno's girl, dick move man.


I could go all night.  But JON fucking SNOW is my hero.  I know the dude is supposed to be the protagonist and is expected to be the cool guy, but dude is bringing his A game to the Nights Watch and I'm loving every second of it.  I love this fucking show so much!!!!!!!


MANCE, next week, you best watch the fuck out.  Jon lost his girl, he's got nothing (knows nothing...), and he's coming your way.

HBOGameofThrones,23dlp6,Weird Joffrey observation.,63,4/18/2014 18:57,2014-16,30,"One of the things that has defined Joffrey's character to me is the way he shakes and shimmies as he speaks, it's a specific way an insecure man tries to act tough that I've seen before, and it's brilliant.  It's the insecure son who's out of his depth, trying to appear tough and in control, consciously trying to have swagger. 
But there was something about it that I couldn't put my finger on, something very familiar.  This morning I was watching the wedding scenes over and over, looking for all the whodonit clues, and it finally hit me:
George W Bush.  He moves his body when he speaks in the same way GW does.

HBOGameofThrones,1v2t4n,Game of Thrones Season 4: Trailer #1 (HBO),51,1/13/2014 2:43,2014-3,3,
HBOGameofThrones,1ef8nu,My thoughts on the Theon Greyjoy torture storyline,50,5/16/2013 1:28,2013-20,15,"I was incredibly fed up with it. I was going to voice how pointless and annoying it is after E07, and talk about how it's a useless distraction from the other fascinating storylines, say that they should just kill him off and be done with it.... But as I was putting these thoughts into words, I had a bit of a revelation.

I thought the Theon storyline was sorely lacking the rest of the story's characteristic commentary on human nature, because it's just about this little psychotic man torturing someone pointlessly. But I realized there is a deeper meaning to it, and it actually has given me another angle for looking at humanity. I'll try to explain.

The significance of Theon's torture isn't about causing pain to a helpless being. It might seem like he's just a chained animal, being hurt for someone's amusement but the choices made by his torturer reveal what makes him (and all of us) so much different from other animals:

Everything he's done to him has revolved around forms of torture that you could never subject a non-human animal to. The things he is exploiting in Theon are the things that define our humanity. This reveals something intrinsic about what it is to be human: our constant need to ask ""Why?"" and to understand our experiences and surroundings gives us a greater capacity for both joy and suffering.

The thing he leverages to psychologically torture Theon is the same thing that has given real-life people our gods (""Why do we exist?""), our science (""Why does this happen this way?""), our philosophy (""Why is this right or wrong?"") and a myriad of other important and uniquely human things. All of these are ways of coping with our endless, obsessive questioning of ""why"" everything.

The torture of Theon shows that no amount of pain inflicted on your physical body can rival the damage of taking away your sense of meaning, your understanding of your experiences and surroundings. And showing this brings about the more useful implication, which is the immeasurable positive value of having meaning, of seeking understanding and achieving a sense of purpose in life.

With this in mind, I'm slightly less dreadful of another drawn-out, cringeworthy scene of torture porn, and a little curious what aspect of human life will be examined next. Whatever happens in life, I can always be thankful I'm not coping with amputated genitals while being tied to a cross in an undisclosed location."

If you play that link, and it doesn’t skip to 36 seconds in, that’s when they start singing.

After hearing him sing in a scene during a rewatch, I realized his voice is really good (and it didn’t sound like a dubbed voice). I decided to look it up, and wouldn’t you know: the dude was a part of Robson & Jerome, who covered Unchained Melody in the mid-90’s and it stayed [at the top of UK charts for 7 weeks and sold over a million copies.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Flynn)

Sorry if this has been posted before, but I just came across it tonight, and it blew my damn mind.

At some point we will arrive at the end of Game of thrones, and probably many deaths will take place. That's when Brandon Stark, son of Eddard Stark, decides he'll travel back in time and try to stop the Night king, his army, and the events from taking place. I will write about his journey back in time after explaining how it's possible he can do this.

When the three-eyed raven says ""You will never walk again, but you will fly"" he means through time, and not only warging a dragon like many fans believe. There was a reason Jojen Reed (who also had the greensight and knew even more things about it than Bran) did not become the three-eyed raven himself.  The reason is that Bran is even more powerful than both Jojen and the three-eyed raven (Brynden Rivers) in the way that he has both greensight and the ability to warg. With this combination Bran is even able to affect the past by warging into Wyllis, and eventually making him become Hodor, which proves ""the ink is dry"". He also gains his fathers attention outside the tower of joy, and even gets touched by the Night king in one of his greensights. Bran believes he is eventually (with more knowledge) going to be able to rewrite history and that's why he decides to go back and stop the Night king several times, but fails every time, ending up fulfilling the timeline-circle and taking the identity of the Night king himself.

The first time, he tries to prepare the Mad king for the white walkers and makes him (through the same whisper-method used to get Neds attention) prepare wildfire under King's landing, where the white walkers attacked (this attack is in the future for us viewers). But Bran fails, as the Mad king goes crazy from the whispers and instead tries to burn the city.

The second time, Bran goes even further back in time (as he continiously learn his abilites he is able do go longer and longer back in time) to try discover how the others were defeated the first time. He fail again and instead succeeds to become Bran the Builder, building the Wall and securing his birth by building Winterfell and creating the words ""There must always be a Stark in Winterfell"".

The last time, Bran goes back all the way to where the Night king was created, to warg into the human that later is going to become the Night king (or maybe even try to kill the children of the forest). He wargs into him to instead stop the ""dragonglass into the heart""-event from happening (or maybe in his attempt to kill the children, he gets chosen as the vessle for the NK). Only he doesn't think of that the children of the forest won't recognize him from the future, and that they at that point are in war with the first men (he is gagged because of all the wierd future-talk). When he realized he failed again, he tries to go back in the current timeline, but can't because he's too deep into the past and stayed to long (""it is beautiful beneath the sea, stay to long and you drown""). From here Bran gets stuck in the past (exactly as Brynden and Jojen warned him not to) and becomes the Night king. With the combination of the childrens magic and Brans power, he becomes the villian instead of the hero he tried to be, resulting in turning against the children for creating him and getting stuck behind the magical Wall he later builds as Bran the builder.

Immortal as he is, he waits for himself to be born thousands of years later, knowing when and where he has to be to mark the young Bran, personally kill Brynden Rivers for hiding the truth about what would happen with him, and eventually being able to destroy the wall with a certain dragon. The reason the Night king doesn't end his misery by killing his younger self, is that he finally learnt the ink is dry, and he would fail again. The reason he doesn't kill Jon Snow, and instead observe him at Hardhome (maybe even resurrected him at Castle black?) will be covered in the end. Ending up marching south and once again fulfilling his timeline which we will see in the following two seasons.

You can actually see in the scene where young Bran goes back to the creation of the Night king, that when the children push the dragonglass into his heart, we see Bran tighten his grip on the veins, just as it is himself experiencing the pain. Also in the end of the flashback, Bran is laying in the exact same position in the cave, as the human pushed up to the tree is.

This theory also parts with Jon snow being the prince that was promised, who eventually has to kill his little brother Bran (Night king cannot kill Jon Snow at Hardhome then, can he?), giving us a bittersweet ending."

These curiosities could, from a certain perspective, suggest the Night King to be the narratively pivotal Rhaegar Targaryen.

&#x200B;

To begin, it would seem to be important to understand the larger story of A Song of Ice and Fire (and subsequently the Game of Thrones television show) in the context of its higher meaning, and the intertwining and unification of its many storylines. Further, it would make sense to believe George RR Martin feels this way as well.  He has invested incredible energy and thought into his life’s work, slowly cultivating the varying, sometimes meandering storylines, and it would be sensible to presume he has a multitude of predetermined broad strokes, fully fleshed arcs planned out, and ultimately these will be reconciled to give a unity and purpose to the greater story.  This means the beginning must be intimately connected to the end, and all the forces acting in the beginning be understood as contributing to all contexts of the story, including the conclusion.

&#x200B;

In the next few sections, the stage for this theory will be set, as there are background aspects that need to be understood and cited to see the landscape of what may be happening.

&#x200B;

**The Tourney at Harrenhal**

&#x200B;

When thinking of beginnings circling back to ends, we must remember the true beginning of A Song of Ice and Fire does not take place in the books.  It happened fifteen years before the events at the beginning of A Game of Thrones.  The true beginning is the event most of the main characters reflect back on, and the event that ultimately triggered Robert’s Rebellion, and the fall of the Targaryen dynasty—The Tourney at Harrenhal.

&#x200B;

Certainly, there is a lot to say about the Tourney at Harrenhal, and everything will not be touched here.  Practically every major character in the series was there, and/or has some intimate connection to the events that transpired.  In understanding the larger theory here, however, it is necessary to expound on certain details, including highly probable speculation and theories already existing within and about the tournament.

&#x200B;

Everyone who was anyone was at the Tournament at Harrenhal—with the exception of Tywin Lannister, who was feuding with King Aerys.  All these participants and spectators were drawn to the sheer scale of the event, spreading over many days and offering grand prizes.  The expense was quite great, and speculated to be well beyond the means of the tournament’s host, Lord Whent.  And indeed, many (in the story) wondered if Rhaegar Targaryen and/or perhaps Tywin Lannister funded the tournament for political reasons—so all the great lords would be gathered in one place, and could discuss the passive removal of Aerys from the throne through Great Council.  There is much speculation here, but such speculation—by both characters and redditors—is fueled or accompanied by Rhaegar’s positive, noble intentions for the Seven Kingdoms.

&#x200B;

During the tournament, various things happened, but one of the notable series of events involves the mysterious Knight of the Laughing Tree.  The emergence of this mystery knight at the tournament begins with the harassment of a crannogman named Howland Reed at the hands of three squires for other knights in the event.  They mocked and beat him, until Lyanna Stark, who was in attendance at Harrenhal with her brothers, observed this and stepped in.  She helped fight the squires off, and later reports this to her brothers. Lyanna tended Howland Reed’s wounds, and he stayed with the Starks at the event.  It was suggested that the crannogman borrow armor and weapons to avenge his honor during the tourney, but he did not want to shame himself or his people. Later, the mysterious Knight of the Laughing Tree emerged, with mismatched armor, and a loud, booming voice, with a laughing weirwood tree painted on the breastplate.  This mystery knight unseated the knights of the mocking squires, and demanded they teach their squires honor, effectively calling them out for their poor behavior, and avenging Howland Reed.

&#x200B;

During this, mad King Aerys was convinced the painted weirwood tree was laughing at him, and that the Knight of the Laughing Tree was his enemy.  He was determined their identity be revealed, and commanded his own knights to fight and unmask him.  By the next day, however, the mystery knight was gone.  Aerys, angered by this, sent his men, including Prince Rhaegar, to apprehend the knight, but he could not be found.

&#x200B;

A popular theory is that Rhaegar did indeed apprehend and unmask the Knight of the Laughing Tree—and upon unmasking discovered none other than Lyanna Stark.

&#x200B;

Rhaegar would go on to win the overall tournament, and upon winning, he presented his favor—a crown of winter roses—not to his wife, but instead to Lyanna Stark, and declared her the Queen of Love and Beauty.  This single event, in addition to her ‘abduction,’ is what would lead to Robert’s Rebellion (since Robert and Lyanna were betrothed).  Of course, this event is not fully understood by anyone who observed it that day (except maybe ancient greenseers witnessing the events).

&#x200B;

Rhaegar did not declare Lyanna the Queen of Love and Beauty out of lust, or some random impulse.  He fell in love with her when he unmasked her as the Knight of the Laughing Tree.  He respected her courage, her honor, her strength, and her skill.  He loved her in a much more meaningful and substantial way than he is often given credit for, and Lyanna loved him as well (she was brought to tears by his singing at the tournament before these events).

&#x200B;

When Rhaegar won the Tourney at Harrenhal, he was the pinnacle of his popularity and success. He was loved and respected by all.  He was noble, intelligent, talented, beautiful, kind, and the definition of a Prince.  When he presented his favor to Lyanna, “the smiles turned to frowns,” because no one understood or could know the true intent of his act (once again, except perhaps ancient greenseers witnessing the events).  But in reality his act was more than one of love.  Perhaps more importantly, he was mirroring and quietly acknowledging the honor of Lyanna, and the respect he had for her.  In reality, he was an even better man and prince than most already believed.

&#x200B;

**Weirwood Trees & Dragonglass**

&#x200B;

The Children of the Forest are known for their close association with weirwood trees and obsidian, or dragonglass, in addition to their strong ties with the paranormal aspects of A Song of Ice and Fire.  Beyond this, it has been established in the books and in the television show that weirwood trees and their associated network serve as a type of conduit to see past, current, and possibly future events, and wargs/greenseers who are powerful enough can see through and beyond the weirwood trees.  The greenseers were the leaders of the Children of the Forest, and used these powers to great effect, and may have even been the proverbial Old Gods themselves.  In the events of the books and in the show, the only remaining greenseers are Brynden Rivers (The Three-Eyed Raven) and Brandon Stark (The New Three-Eyed Raven). Though, we do meet other wargs in the series, including Varamyr Sixskins, who can warg into many animals, and even attempts to warg into a woman.

&#x200B;

Being able to warg into an animal(s) could be thought of as warging 1.0, and greensight might be thought of as warging 2.0.  Typical wargs can go into the mind of an animal(s) in real time, whereas fully realized greenseers can go into pretty much anything, anytime.  We know either can be dangerous, however, as we have seen the downsides of this with Varamyr Sixskins trying to inhabit the mind of another woman, which drives her quite insane.  We also have Brynden Rivers warning Brandon not to linger too long in the sea of the past, lest he drown there.  And, of course, we have the infamous Hodor scenario, where Brandon directly influences the past, and all events (saying exclusively Hodor) throughout Hodor’s life.  It has been established warging/greensight can be utilized not only for seeing, and influencing other events, but also in transferring consciousness.

&#x200B;

If weirwood trees represent the northern, cold magic aspect of these strange powers, then obsidian/dragonglass would certainly be the fire magic corollary.  It is referenced how the Valyrians used glass candles (dragonglass devices) to communicate with each other over vast distances, and even enter the dreams and thoughts of others.  In the books, Daenerys experiences a vision with Quaithe where glass candles are described as burning, and Xaro Xhoan Daxos communicates a similar message to her as well.  Why are glass candles burning now?  What has changed to make them burn?  Are these comments regarding glass candles meant to be generic, or are they meant to quietly herald the burning of a particular glass candle?

&#x200B;

Additionally, when Sam is speaking with Marwyn about the utility of glass candles in AFFC.

“*The sorcerers of the Freehold could see across mountains, seas, and* *deserts with one of these glass candles.* *They could enter a man’s dreams and give him visions, and speak to one another half a world apart, seated before their candles.*  *Do you think that might be useful, Slayer?”*

Sam says,“*We would have no more need of ravens*.”

“*Only after battles,”* The archmaester peeled a sourleaf off a bale, shoved it in his mouth, and began to chew it.

Though this exchange is cryptic, with Marwyn’s strange reference to battles, it is clear glass candles have similar powers (communication, consciousness transfer) to weirwood trees, and they will likely be relevant in the broader story.

&#x200B;

**The Motivation of the Children of the Forest**

&#x200B;

In the Game of Thrones television show, we see Bran and the Three-Eyed-Raven in a vision showing the presumptive creation of the Night King (Season 6, Episode 5 – The Door).  This vision sequence is rather sudden, without context, and meant to be taken at face value in every way.  We see a man (the actor who plays the Night King) tied to a weirwood tree, and we see a group of Children of the Forest staring at him, before promptly impaling him with a shard of dragonglass.  His eyes then turn blue.  Bran falls out of this vision, and this exchange occurs with the Child of the Forest with him in the cave.  Below is literally the language from the script for this scene in the episode.

&#x200B;

\*LEAF is watching BRAN. BRAN releases the root of the tree and wakes up from his vision.

\*BRAN: It was you. You made the White Walkers.

\*LEAF: We were at war. We were being slaughtered. Our sacred trees cut down. We needed to defend ourselves.

\*BRAN: From whom?

\*LEAF: From you. From men.

\**LEAF exits. BRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN stare at each other.*

&#x200B;

This is all we are given concerning the creation of the Night King, and we are meant to take what we see and hear entirely at face value—that the Children of the Forest created the white walkers as a weapon against men.  In reality, however, there is no context to this scene, and we really do not know the intentions behind their actions.

&#x200B;

Historically, the Children of the Forest have employed passive, preventative measures to protect themselves, and are known for their deep, peaceful connection with the earth. When the First Men came to Westeros by crossing the land bridge once connecting Westeros to Essos, the Children tried to stop them by shattering and destroying this land bridge, creating the Narrow Sea.  Later, the Children flooded the Neck (a thinner area on the continent of Westeros) in order to try to prevent the northern advancement of men.  These attempts to intervene with the First Men invasion of their land are passive, preventative, and in alignment with the peaceful style of the Children of the Forest.

&#x200B;

Going back to the Night King/White Walker creation scene from the television show, we are expected to believe the Children of the Forest essentially created an army of ice zombies as a weapon of mass destruction to combat men.  But, this concept is counterintuitive to the style and basic MO of the Children of the Forest, which has been established to be passive, preventative, and rooted in unity.  It is reasonable that the true, underlying spirit of what we are witnessing in this scene will turn out to follow this same pattern, and the intent likely geared toward the passive, preventative, and healing—not destructive.

&#x200B;

In the same way that the Children of the Forest tried to passively, preventatively intervene with the landscape of Westeros to discourage the advancement and onslaught of men, I believe we are witnessing something similar in this scene.  When they realize Men are too numerous and strong, they will no longer seek geographic protection, but instead intend to change Men themselves, and effectively heal them of their barbarity. Using their powers of greensight—they scour their visions throughout time, searching for the best of us, searching for the best leader of men they can find.  They discover Rhaegar Targaryen.

&#x200B;

**The End of Rhaegar & the Beginning of the Night King**

&#x200B;

We are told repeatedly about the mythic confrontation of Robert and Rhaegar in the shallows of the Trident River.  There, in the frenzy of single combat, Rhaegar had his chest smashed in by Robert’s war hammer, and perished.  Rhaegar’s elaborate breastplate—comprised of rubies arranged into the three-headed dragon of the Targaryen sigil—was splintered, and the rubies scattered throughout the waters, ever after named the Ruby Ford.  We have also found out how unreliable these accounts can be, and I believe we will discover there was more to this confrontation than the folklore/Baratheon propaganda reveal.

&#x200B;

The glorious, single blow, chest-smashing death of Rhaegar Targaryen—the enemy prince, son of the Mad King, abductor and rapist of Lyanna Stark—is the type of lore and propaganda one might expect to emerge from the winner of a dynasty shifting battle.  It may be revealed, however, that the landmark blow Robert landed on Rhaegar did not immediately kill him, and I believe it to be more likely that this infamous blow merely cracked/penetrated Rhaegar’s armor (which may have contained dragonglass in the ornamentation?), and following this they frantically wrestled hand-to-hand in the shallow water. In desperation, the killing blow from Robert likely came from what we know as the Catspaw dagger—which he either pulled from his own side, or probably from the side of Rhaegar himself—and plunged it into his heart, through the broken breastplate.  This frantic, haphazard killing lacks the romanticism of a single blow from a hammer.

&#x200B;

The ancient greenseers of the Children of the Forest, having seen in Rhaegar Targaryen everything they wish the First Men possessed—either by chance, or perhaps their design—follow Rhaegar to his fate on the Trident that day.  And in Rhaegar’s moment of death at the Trident, they are able to effectively save his mind within the core of a glass candle in the ancient past, only to wake again in the body of another.  The dragonglass we see being plunged into the man tied to the weirwood tree in the past, is actually a glass candle holding the mind of Rhaegar Targaryen.

&#x200B;

The sheer act of Rhaegar’s death—an object being plunged into the chest—directly parallels the creation of the Night King—with the dragonglass/glass candle being plunged into the man tied to the weirwood tree.  It may be this parallel in death with related means which allowed for Rhaegar’s mind to be transferred.  The Catspaw dagger is Valyrian Steel, with a dragonbone hilt, but in the show the dagger is presented as Valyrian steel with dragonglass associated with the hilt. Indeed, an obvious picture of the dagger can be seen in the book Sam is reading about dragonglass (Season 7, Episode 1 – Dragonstone).  The text from the page in that book reads:

&#x200B;

*The Valyrians were familiar with dragonglass long before they came to Westeros. They called it ""zīrtys perzys"" which translated to “frozen fire” in Valyrian and eastern tales tell of how their dragons would thaw the stone with dragonflame until it became molten and malleable. The Valyrians then used it to build their strange monuments and building without seams and joints of our modern castles.  When Aegon the conqueror forged his Seven Kingdoms, he and his descendants would often* ***decorate their blades with dragonglass*** *feeling a kinship with the stone. The royal fashion for dragonglass ornamentation soon spread throughout the Seven Kingdoms to those wealthy enough to afford it.* ***Hilts and pommels were and are the most common decoration for dragonglass*** *if too brittle to make a useful crossguard. Indeed, its very brittleness is what relegates it to the great houses and the most successful merchants.*

&#x200B;

In season 7 the Catspaw dagger featured heavily.  Not only was it the notorious dagger utilized in the assignation attempt on Bran Stark himself, effectively serving as the device which set off many events within the main story of the first book/season, but it has narrative significance spanning many seasons.  Its resurgence within the story, and the heavy highlights—presence within the dragonglass book, presentation to Bran by Petyr Baelish, gifting from Bran to Arya—are not done frivolously, and the dagger is being set up for future narrative significance. I believe we will find out the dagger was used to kill Rhaegar Targaryen, and I also believe we will find out its properties allowed the Children of the Forest to save his mind and bring him to the past to be a leader of the First Men.

&#x200B;

The individual chosen is likely already an ancient leader of the First Men.  He may have been abducted.  He may have come with the Children willingly.  In any event, the individual we see tied to the weirwood tree is likely someone of importance and influence, probably a King or Prince of the First Men—probably a Stark ancestor.  The Children of the Forest selected this person to house the mind of Rhaegar Targaryen, either to imbue him with traits of Rhaegar, or to outwardly embody Rhaegar himself.  They were trying to create a better leader for men, to herald a change in the aggressive, destructive mindset the First Men had embraced up to this point. Rhaegar may have indeed been The Prince That Was Promised, except he was a promised prince to the First Men in the ancient past.

&#x200B;

Obviously, something went terribly wrong, and after the Night King was created, presumptively the Long Night occurs, in which the Children of the Forest are forced to fight with the First Men to defeat the White Walkers, etc.

&#x200B;

Ultimately, even if the nuances of these events are not mapped out with exacting accuracy, there are far too many parallels between the death of Rhaegar and the creation of the Night King for them to be unrelated.  Though, I believe the big picture suggests the Night King is Rhaegar himself, or has his mind in some meaningful way via the glass candle in his chest.

&#x200B;

Beyond everything discussed above, there are other contextual or metaphoric suggestions of parallels between the death of Rhaegar Targaryen and the creation of the Night King.

* The new prophecy revealed in the recently published, “Fire and Blood, page 497,” overtly suggests a connection between Rhaegar and the Night King.
   * *‘And talk was heard in camp of a prophecy of ancient days that said, ""When the Hammer shall fall upon the dragon, a new king shall arise, and none shall stand before him.""’*
   * Of course, in the context of the text, this prophecy is presented as history regarding a figure known as Hugh the Hammer during the early days of Targaryen rule in Westeros, but the striking imagery between Robert and Rhaegar, and the subsequent rise of a ‘new king’ none shall stand before is in complete alignment with this theory.
* In the show, we see the Night King walk through fire multiple times.  In the show, only Daenerys/Targaryens are implied to have this sort of immunity/resistance to fire.
* The Night King is literally riding a dragon.  In the mythos of GRRM, only dragonlords of Valyria—or people descended from them—are ever described as riding dragons.
* The scattered rubies of the sigil also serve as a metaphor for transformation.  The Rhaegar Targaryen we know has disappeared, scattered into the rivers of time, and what survives in the past is not what we recognize.
* &#x200B;

**Review of Basic Background Points & Proposed Theory**

&#x200B;

* Rhaegar Targaryen was a quintessential prince.  He was noble, intelligent, talented, beautiful and kind.  He was adored and respected by all.  In many ways, he represented the best of us.
* Weirwood trees and dragonglass (glass candles) have similar functionalities.  They allow proficient users to see events across time, and enter the thoughts and dreams of others, which can include consciousness transfer.
* The Children of the Forest have been historically passive, employing largely preemptive, non-aggressive means to protect themselves and their interests (i.e. shattering the Arm of Dorne, flooding the Neck), and the creation of a ruthless army of ice zombies is not fundamentally their style or MO.
* When the aforementioned passive means of stopping the First Men failed, they decided to attempt to change/improve the First Men themselves—beginning with giving them a better leader, perhaps a promised prince.
* The Children of the Forest scoured their visions across time searching for the best of us, and they found Rhaegar Targaryen, a perfect prince and an ideal leader of men.
* Either by chance, or by design, they followed Rhaegar to his death at the Trident, and when he died (in a manner which tremendously parallels the creation of the Night King, and likely involving the infamous Catspaw dagger), they saved his mind via a glass candle in the ancient past.
* They procured a leader of the First Men (likely an ancient Stark), and implanted this glass candle into him, hoping to imbue the best of Rhaegar, or outwardly embody Rhaegar himself, in this individual.
* When the Children of the Forest created what would become the Night King, they were actually attempting to give the First Men a better leader (perhaps a promised prince), by transferring the consciousness of the best person across time they could find into a contemporary leader of First Men.
* Something went horribly wrong, and the Night King is a crazed combination of two minds—the ancient Stark, and Rhaegar Targaryen—both alive in the same body.

&#x200B;

**Bonus and Beyond the Theory:**  **What Does the Night King Want?**

&#x200B;

Something obviously went horribly and unpredictably wrong with the Children’s plan to give the First Men a better leader, and the motivations for the Night King—even with this theory, are not straightforward to identify.  Though, I believe the key to understanding will ultimately be found in a frequently stated adage in the books and in the show—*only death can pay for life*.  I am currently writing a follow-up, which details a theory I have on the intentions of the Night King.

Valyrian steel comes from a land of dragons where there is likely to be much dragon glass. The method used to make Valyrian steel has been long lost (along with dragons before the beginning of our story) I think the Valyrians found a way to forge steel with dragon glass in it to make Valyrian steel. Typical forging methods wouldn’t be hot enough to melt dragon glass to combine it with steel, dragon fire though obviously would. I believe dragon glass + steel + dragon fire = Valyrian steel.

Here's my theory: Olenna was promised to Aemon, but had no interest in him since he was the second in line, after his brother. Then, she decided to seduce the Tyrell, who was the heir of Highgarden and better ranked than a Targaryen who's unlikely to become a king. She got married and Aemon went to study to become a master.

gottheories,6wm4vo,My Final Theory,70,8/28/2017 20:24,2017-35,13,"Okay, I've been working on a complicated theory for how the war will end, and here it is. This will be a composite of some common theories as well as a major one which I believe is new.

Those who choose to fight the dead will try to stop them at Moat Cailin, the bottleneck separating northern and southern Westeros. They manage to reduce its size but at a massive cost, and the survivors have to fall back to the south.

As the dead approach King's Landing and Cersei realizes that all is lost, she prepares the wildfire, deciding that she'd rather blow up the entirety of King's Landing than let the whites take it. Jaime kills his sister to stop her, just like he did the Mad King.

Chekhov's Gun is still loaded though, and as the white walkers breach the walls of King's Landing and the dragons start to fall, Bran acts. Warging into one of the dragons, he purposefully ignites the wildfire and destroys all of King's Landing, the Red Keep, all of the dead, and many of the living.

The living win the war, at great cost. As seven free kingdoms, Westeros might have teamed up and decisively defeated the white walkers. Instead though, they all served one king, and Westeros was too caught up in playing the game of thrones to focus on what was most important.

King's Landing and all the politics behind its walls is as much an enemy to Westeros as the dead are, but only someone like Bran, who cares for humanity but is himself detached from it, who understands that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, could take such a destructive action. 

Thus the story of Westeros is book-ended by two Brans; Bran the Builder, and Bran the Destroyer.

gottheories,astteu,Sansa Stark is the Night Queen/Princess Who Was Promised.,72,2/20/2019 21:11,2019-8,10,"The Princess Who Was Promised will become the Night Queen and she is Sansa Stark... and Arya Stark will kill her. The sister swords theory.

Let’s start with the assumption that The White Walkers are the ones who have a prince or princess promised to them, not the humans. (I have seen this as a stand alone theory.) If we can make this assumption, then we can make another. The Prince/ Princess Who Was Promised might not be who we think it is, or mean what we think it means.

Sansa Stark is the Princess Who Was Promised to the White Walkers and she will bring the dawn... or at least her death will. 

It has long been speculated as to what the Walkers actually want. They are no longer receiving their sacrifices from Craster, which is their only means of reproduction as far as anyone knows. They want a Night Queen. The 13th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch was a Stark (supposedly) and he married a Female Walker and ruled as King and Queen. Perhaps this was part of an oath, treaty or marriage pact. The Starks and Walkers exchange brides for peace. The Walkers need reproduction. They need a Stark princess. They want their Night Queen as they were promised. 

But Sansa is not a princess? That depends on your point of view. The Starks were Kings in the North long before the Targaryens conquered Westeros. Perhaps, the White Walkers recognize no King BUT the King in The North whose name is Stark? This would make Sansa and Arya princesses to the Walkers. 

Why Sansa and not Arya? Does the prophecy actually fit? The prophecy states the Prince/Princess will be born amongst salt and smoke and their coming will be heralded by a bleeding star. (Among other things, but let’s start with these basics.) In actuality, this refers to a  person’s rebirth and that is important. So where was Sansa at the time of the bleeding star/comet? In King’s Landing, she had just gotten her first period and it was the battle of Blackwater Bay. King’s Landing is surrounded on three sides by salt water and this was a naval battle fought with Wildfire. We have salt and smoke! All these elements combined with her reproductive awakening is what makes her the princess who was promised!

There is a certain irony in this, as Sansa has always wanted to be Queen. 

There is also a certain irony in that once Arya has finally learned to love and respect her sister that she will be the one who has to kill her. 

The fate and dispositions of the direwolves mirrors the fate of their Stark counterparts. I long thought Sansa would not survive to the end because her wolf, Lady did not. The funny thing is that Lady did not simply die, she was killed... by a Stark. Ned Stark killed her reluctantly and almost as a mercy, as Arya will have to do to Sansa. 


Further evidence from the books, Sansa has a dream the night she got her period in King’s Landing. Women crawling over her like “weasels” stabbing her with knives, she screamed (wailed?) and “no one” heard her….So “weasel” and “no one” are both aliases of  Arya. And who just so happens to have a valyrian steel dagger, capable of killing a female White Walker?

I also find it interesting that the Stark’s Valyrian steel sword, Ice, was melted down and turned into two smaller swords, Oathkeeper and Widow’s Wail. Assuming nothing happens without a reason, why? 

Women use smaller swords. Oathkeeper and Widow’s Wail are sister swords. Stark sister swords!

I think Arya’s sword is Widow’s Wail. Perhaps Jaime will gift it to her? Sansa is technically a widow. When Arya kills her, will the widow wail?

That makes Oathkeeper Sansa’s sword. Brienne wields it in her name, for her protection. But Sansa is literally the oath that was made to the Walkers. She is the keeper of that oath, The Princess Who Was Promised!

Theory…

Whether Azor Ahai ever before existed is moot to this theory. What we know has been deliberately framed as being a story of the past. What is known of Azor Ahai’s story (explained below) is either: a) a prophecy of WHAT WILL HAPPEN; or b) what WILL HAPPEN is a retelling of a past hero. IT DOESN’T MATTER, either way. Here we go.

Jon, is Azor Ahai. Fine. Not new, but what does Azor Ahai’s story tell us about how the story will end IF THIS IS TRUE? It tell us everything. The centre to this theory is the truth about Lightbringer. Remember prophecy is always deliberately misleading.

""Darkness lay over the world and Azor Ahai was the hero chosen to fight against it. To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword.""

Lightbringer is not a sword it is a dragon. The sword: Dawn, is a red herring for those searching for clues. There are no magic swords. There are magic creatures: Dragons, and they’ve been lighting things up for a while.

This theory relies on a reinterpretation of the making of Lightbringer. There were three attempts to forge Lightbringer. What else comes in threes? Dragons.

A sword to fight the darkness.

Lightbringer ATTEMPT 1! 

We saw it happen yesterday. Sword one: ""when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke”. 

What just met a watery grave, killed by frozen water? A dragon. Who committed Viserion to this task? Jon, or Dany? Jon did. The events where caused by Jon in his heroic quest.

So, where does this train of thought lead us… To the FUTURE!

Lightbringer ATTEMPT 2!

""The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered.”

The mention of a Lion seem a little too coincidental? Was this ever an ACTUAL Lion? Haven’t seen many Lions around. But plenty of Lannisters.

House Lannister will go down in flames. The fight WILL cost them dragon number two. Seems very feasible, in terms of both story and show.

Lightbringer ATTEMPT 3!

""The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew beforehand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her living heart, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer.”

If you’ve read this far then you probably know where I’m going. The bittersweet…  before the final fight Jon will lose Dany. Who may or may not be his wife at this point. Doesn’t really matter. Dany and her dragons already share a soul so she will be the soul that is intertwined with Lightbringer. Jon will wield the final weapon: Lightbringer, in the form of the remaining dragon. Likely Drogon since they have already had a moment together. This will leave Jon to fight the NK. 

Fire vs Ice. 
Light vs Darkness.

This works on multiple levels. It means we have a finale with a 1:1, with an even more tragic Jon, following the tragedy of losing Dany. We get our ice vs fire. Our dragon vs dragon. Light vs Darkness. A hero wielding a magic weapon of fire against the darkness. Azor Ahai reborn… Azor Ahai WAS literally reborn when Jon was RETURNED from the dead. Plus the prophecy nicely doesn’t tell you the final outcome.

It works with Dany and Jon swapping taking place. There are arguments on detail that work either way. But my money is on Jon since I suspect he has a more of a personal connection to NK and everything hints they need a showdown.

gottheories,axc66x,Is Bran the prince that was promised (to the Night King as his heir)?,57,3/4/2019 20:49,2019-10,13,"A GREAT theory that has been discussed a lot lately is the potential that the Night King's true motivation is to take an heir that is owed to him from the Starks: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEud33zwWCA&t=30s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEud33zwWCA&t=30s). In this version of the theory, the war with the white walkers would end with Jon Snow and Daenerys, sacrificing their newborn son to the Night King as a sort of truce. The Night King would take the child as his heir.

The basic summary of the theory: throughout GOT, pacts are always made through marriage, and even the exchange of children (like Theon Greyjoy or Craster's sons). Knowing George Martin's manipulation of language, the ""prince that was promised"" could be a play on words, meaning ""the prince that was promised"" was not a warrior that defeated the Night King, but a ""prince"" that was ""promised"" to the White Walkers as a sort of truce. Throughout the show and books, it's always discussed how Men were almost wiped out by the WWs and had no chance of winning, but then some miracle hero (Azor etc) saved them. It seems unrealistic that one hero could defeat an army of the undead. What if Men didn't win, but made an agreement to survive. In the show thus far, we haven't seen any female WWs and the only way the WWs have been able to reproduce is by changing Craster's sons with the touch of the Night King. Also, in the cave paintings beneath Dragonstone, the drawing of the NK includes a beard and since the current NK doesn't have a beard, it seems highly possible that there has been more than one NK throughout history, which would suggest some kind of succession. The problem for the Night King with Craster's sons is that they aren't of royal blood and if there was a pact involving the sacrifice of a child to end the Long Night, it almost certainly would have had to involve a child of royal blood, which is where Dany and Jon's future baby come into play.

My spin-off version of this theory starts with Bran: what if Bran is the ""prince"" that the Night King is after? Throughout the show, we hear the three-eyed-raven telling Bran that he is going to help end the war, but maybe it's not in the way that we think. Bran is a prince of royal/Stark blood and also a Greenseer LIKE the Night King so he would be a perfect heir in terms of abilities (raising the dead/seeing into the future etc). In the books, it's hinted that the NK was a Stark before becoming a WW. Winterfell was also probably named after the physical location of where ""Winter"" fell the last time, so chances are high that if a sacrifice was given to the WWs, it was a Stark child (maybe that's why there must always be a Stark in Winterfell). The scene where the NK grabs Bran's arm and chases after him  clearly shows that the NK has an interest in Bran specifically. On a smaller note, it's believed that the dire-wolves reflect the fate of their owners. Bran's dire-wolf's name is Summer, so could he be the reason Summer comes after this current winter? Bran is also the only Stark that didn't appear in the teaser for GOT season 8. He doesn't have a statue in the crypts where Starks are buried like Jon, Arya, and Sansa. It's possible that Bran isn't included because he is now the Three-Eyed-Raven, but the same could be said about Arya Stark who has gone back and forth with being No-One. What if Bran isn't in the crypts because his story/life doesn't end in Winterfell, but North of the Wall instead? Lastly, the name Brandon Stark has always been renowned throughout the Stark lineage. Brandon Stark was the founder of House Stark and the Builder of the Wall and Winterfell. Brandon Starks have clearly had a huge impact on history. Wouldn't it be appropriate if Bran Stark fulfilled the name he was given by ending the war?

So, Jon Snow is Aegon Targaryen. People assume he will ride one of Daenerys’ dragons, probably Rhaegal, but he has yet to do so. And there is sufficient evidence to think he never will. 

Jon is half Targaryen, half Stark. Just maybe he is The Song of Ice and Fire, but maybe that doesn’t mean what we think it means.

Early on in the series, when the first wights are brought into Castle Black, Jon is burned in the ensuing fight. It is noted multiple times throughout the books, at least, that he was indeed burned. I don’t think something being mentioned several times is a coincidence. As Daenerys said, fire cannot kill a dragon, but it could obviously kill Jon. So Jon Snow is not a dragon….at least not a fire dragon.

Ice dragons are mentioned early on in this series as well, in Old Nan’s tales of the long night, then seemingly forgotten. But they are as likely to be real as Dany's’ dragons, the White Walkers, direwolves and giants. Why drop this “character” if it is of no significance?

It is important to note that Jon and other characters have been brought back from death. Those who are risen from the dead by the red priests are changed by their experience. Additionally, any wounds received at or around the time of their death never really heal and return to normal. (Not so obvious in the show as the books.) For example, Catlin Stark/Lady Stoneheart’s personality has changed, her throat remains slit so she cannot speak. Beric Dondarrion perpetually loses his memories.

Red priestess Melisandre tells Varys that she is going to Volantis and that she will return. I think she will bring back to Westeros a group of red priests. Somehow, the red priests will be able to raise Viserion and truly bring him back from the dead but he will never be a normal, fire-breathing dragon again. His time with the Night King will have changed him...He will be an ice dragon. 

Viserion is Jon’s dragon, risen from the dead, just as Jon was.

 Jon Snow is an ice dragon!

Note(s):

 The fate and dispositions (and even names) of the direwolves mirrors the fate of their Stark counterparts. Jon’s wolf is named Ghost, literally the soul of a dead person. Jon is the risen dead. Doesn’t it make sense that his dragon have a similar “theme”? (For lack of a better word.)

Even the color scheme is reminiscent for me. The white wolf and the cream dragon.

Only Death can stop the dead. 
(I am using my iPhone so my apologies for lack of links, grammar/spelling and missing images)

Let’s start with the end of Arya’s Hero journey and how it brings her back home to use her Boon for the betterment of all mankind. 


When Arya was stabbed by the Waif she was symbolically and literally stabbed in the womb. This act was used to symbolically and literally show the death of her womanhood. As we have seen before with the Spider, Theon and the Unsullied, men are symbolically and literally stripped of their manhood when their male sex organs are removed. 
This has happened Arya. The Waif stabbing her womb ultimately kills her womanhood. When she falls in the water and is cleansed of her womb-death she emerges again reborn. This allows her to fulfill her role as the Stranger, the God of death that is neither male nor female. 

Chaste. Arya is not once raped or defiled. She neither takes a lover or partner willingly. As a Virgin Arya is being setup as the divine virgin from nearly every mythos. As the Chaste divine virgin it will ultimately be Arya who saves the Realm of men. She is the only character that stays true to her nature. Even Jon Snow fucked a wilding and forsakes his oaths. Oath-breakers are the worst people in Norse Paganism. Only Arya has kept her oaths, remains loyal to her family and begins her Hero Quest by ending her Hero’s journey by going back home to Winterfell. 

Littlefinger acts as a greek chorus for the audience when he reveals a truth about the show. He says to Sansa “...Everything you’ve seen before you’ll see again...”
At the red wedding, Robs bride was stabbed in her pregnant belly and Arya herself when she annihilates the Frey’s reminds the men of why they’ve been killed. 
“Yes, yes. Cheer. Brave men, all of you,"" Arya said. ""Butchered a woman pregnant with her baby. Cut the throat of a mother of five. Slaughtered your guests after inviting them into your home.""
She is the vanguard of proper etiquette. The cultural norms of the Norse, Teutonic and Germanic peoples are very serious. Disrespecting hospitality rules is the business of the Stranger or in Norse terms, Wandering Greybeard (Odin) to correct. As the stranger Arya is measuring each interaction she has on the road home and deciding discriminately whether-the rules of hearth& home, welcoming a stranger to your fire, are being upheld. 


But let’s take a step back to see where we’re going, 
When Arya was in the House of Black & White she was blinded by the Faceless Man. He then drinks the poison meant to Kill Arya to die for her and therefore he ultimately strips Arya of her name in a final death. She goes to reveal his true face and see’s herself. Why? Because Arya has lived many times just like her brother Bran. 

Now let’s take another step back. 
I’m writing this theory with the hopes that the reader can do their own research. It’s very important to understand Norse Paganism intimately to see where this series is ending. 
In Norse Mythology the Norns are 3 sisters who see the Past, Present and Future. They do this by living IN the roots of the worldtree Yggdrasil. 
*See Wikipedia definition here 
“In Snorri Sturluson's interpretation of the Völuspá, Urðr (Wyrd), Verðandi and Skuld, the three most important of the Norns, come out from a hall standing at the Well of Urðr or Well of Fate. They draw water from the well and take sand that lies around it, which they pour over Yggdrasill so that its branches will not rot.[2] These three Norns are described as powerful maiden giantesses (Jotuns) whose arrival from Jötunheimr ended the golden age of the gods.[2] They may be the same as the maidens of Mögþrasir who are described in Vafþrúðnismál (see below).[2]”

Of the Starks only 3 siblings remain. Remember Jon is a cousin. Sansa Mother, Arya Maiden, Bran Crone. Gender norms are not consistent here. Sansa was married off and brutally raped, as the Lady of Winterfell she acts as the mother to all the men in her realm. Arya is chaste and is truly the only divine virgin and Bran is a seer and becomes the crone. The 3 sister Norns. The 3 Stark siblings. 

This is really important. The Starks are wolves. The wolf can be a Warg or Were. Where Bran is a Warg truly, Arya is a Were. He can possess the bodies of animals, originally namely wolves or his wolf summer and later principally he possesses the ravens. 

Ravens and Wolfs are incredibly important in Norse mythology as they are the familiars and companions of Odin the Allfather. But more on this important piece in a bit. 

Back to Bran and Arya. Bran had to die in the roots of the world tree to become the 3 eyed raven which is a direct homage to the 3 sister Norns and Odins 2 Ravens that travel the 9 realms seeing and hearing everything and reporting back to him. Bran didn’t really become the 3 eyed raven. He already is, was and always will be the 3 eyed raven. The unnamed old man or predecessor in the roots was a prior avatar of Bran who finally came to find death again and allows present Bran to take over as Crone. 

Arya doesn’t become the Stranger she IS the Stranger. Season 7 gave us the final proof that she is. On more than one occasion firstly with Lannister soldiers and secondly with Hotpie Arya is treated as the wandering stranger and in accordance with the light of the seven rules and Norse culture over-tunes, we see that as the stranger, she is properly treated and therefore as a proper response does not kill men she despises and is warmed by the treatment from someone who considers her a friend.  In both occasions the Stranger is treated as a welcomed guest and by following a strict adherence to hospitality rules, Arya, as the Stranger doesn’t punish them with death. 

Arya is the ultimate outsider. She behaves like a boy which in the entirely gendered society of Westoros is not only frowned upon but is truly against the rules. Again in season 7 her story arch is revealed when she talks with Sansa about how she knew she wasn’t doing anything wrong the rules were wrong. Once again we see that like the Stranger who is not gendered, Arya embraces the embodiment of being entirely gender neutral. 

When the Faceless Man falls dead she pulls off his faces and sees herself. Why? Because she has already lived, died and lived again. The Faceless Men can only have faces of people who have died. There are no replicas. As a true Were Arya is able to easily master the magic of skinwalking and to see her own face only means one thing. She has lived and died before. 

For her Hero journey to come to an end by returning home again we know that her new Hero Quest has begun. 

Arya is given an ancient Valerian Steel dagger by Bran. As he hands it to her he looks worried and sad. Bran already knows what his sisters fate is. As the Crone he is the seer of man’s fate. He knows that Arya is death and to end all the dead and make sure they are returned back to the other side, Arya must fully embrace her nature. She is death. 


Now I’m not entirely sure how the show will wrap up. However it seems to me that the only thing that will stop the dead is to make sure the master of Death is back in the realm of the dead. Arya will be the Queen of Death. For this to happen she will die.


***Disclaimer I wrote this to get it off my chest. I didn’t do a painstaking amount of supporting evidence because it’s what I already know. I’d love to read anyone’s supporting evidence for my theory.

EVERYONE, and I mean EVERYONE, white walkers, humans, children of the forest and everyone in between gets killed off. 
Except for Bronn. Final scenes are him just traveling through a Westerosi wasteland. His dream of castle ownership has finally come true because he has his choice of ANY or ALL of them, but Twilight Zone style there is no-one left to be impressed by his castle ownership. 
Bronn searches around, finds one he likes, shrugs his shoulders, then just walks into his new kingdom...

gottheories,8rmysk,Theory that Daenerys will become an actual dragon,47,6/16/2018 22:57,2018-24,19,"I've been waiting for someone to pick up on a hint Emelia Clark gave in a recent quote but no one has, so here goes.  She said it's going to mess people up when they find out WHAT SHE IS, not WHO she is.  I think she's  a dragon trapped in human form.
3 fires you must light... one TO love.  If the Night King on Viserion tries to blast John Snow with dragon fire, Daenerys could push him out of harms way and get hit herself. This could be the third fire that sets her free. And Daenerys Targaryan flew... (GOT)If she turns into a dragon and fires on the Night King she fulfils many prophecies.
She becomes The Stallion that mounts the world,and Azor Ahai, her dragon flame becomes lightbringer. Aimed at Viserion he becomes Nissa Nissa. Their dance of dragons becomes a song  of ice and fire.
In the books Quaith asks if Daenerys knows who she is because her dragons do. She is a dragon. 
Her titles of Mother of Dragons/ Breaker of Chains, and her belief that a dragon is not a slave refrences breaking the Night Kings hold over Viserion. Parents will do anything to protect their children even if they must put them down.( the father and child the Hound sees in the burned out hovel).
She may be able to restore Viserion through her fire.
She is also told 'To reach the light you must pass beneath the shadow... 'That shadow is Asshai.  If she flies to Asshai and breathes the dragon fire on the dragon eggs that are still there, she will wake the dragons from stone and lift the shadow from Asshai. This also fulfills her being the Amethyst Empress come again. She dreams of the Gemstone Emperors early in the series and recognizes them as her ancestors. They were skinchangers, don't foget.
Its too late in the game for Daenerys to be pregnant, besides John Snow died. His babyjuice may not work. You'd have a million to one chance of getting pregnant after one encounter. It's  misdirection on GRRMS part. Like Tyrion says, 'If you think this story has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention.
There's  a second link to her becoming a dragon... If she goes to Kings Landing and is burned by Cercei as a pubic display of power and THAT fire transformes Daenerys, she could be the shadow flying over Kings Landing in Bran's vision
Either way, I think Daenerys will transform into a dragon"

gottheories,9r6yoq,Robert Arryn is important,44,10/25/2018 4:09,2018-43,18,"Why Robert Arryn is more important than he seems. 
Jon Arryn may be the least talked about character since season 1. Which is surprising since he was one of the men that Ned Stark admired most. And because his death literally sets off the entire series. 
Let’s start with Ned- despite seeing or hearing of his natural father in the books, we learn very little about him as well, other than he had “southron ambitions” and the infamous story of his death by the hand of the Mad King. By all accounts, it’s easy to see there was a strong bond or plan of arrangement between House Stark and House Arryn. A bond of marriage is what typically was seen as a political move, and there is an obvious bond between House Tully and Stark. But what about fostering another’s child? My guess is that this was a powerful political maneuver that was being used to rise against the current throne. 
Take for example the fostering of Ned and Robert by Jon Arryn. Jon has been married twice with both wives passed away, childless. Why offer your children to a powerful house very far away from home where the elderly lord is childless? This wasn’t a random event, Robert Baratheon was the first born son of the Stormlord/House Baratheon. To further solidify this bond, when ordered by the Mad King to deliver Ned Stark to Kings Landing as a traitor, Jon Arryn raised his banners in revolt. He literally started a war on Ned’s behalf of House Stark. 
Following the war, he was Robert’s hand and all that we know of him was that Ned Stark, the most honorable man in Westeros looked up to him. Ned married Catelyn in the same wedding ceremony as Jon to Lysa. We know he was thought of highly and had no enemies. And yet, he was killed by his wife, under the guidance of Petyr Baelish and his son was ferried away to the Vale.
Important to understanding that Robyn is important is another part of the unanswered confusion that Maester Coleman and Catelyn have about where Jon Arryn planned to foster his son prior to his death. By all accounts, it was Dragonstone with Stannis as Maester Coleman corrects Catelyn. Yet Lysa and at least one other person are under the impression it was Tywin Lannister who was going to foster him, the first ever offer of Tywin to foster anybody. Doesn’t make a lot of sense unless….
You look up the name Arryn. It means lightbringer. And if Jon planned to foster Robyn Arryn at Dragonstone with Stannis, it would explain Melisandre’s mistaken identity of Stannis wielding lightbringer. She also says, I ask the lord for a glimpse of Azor Ahai and all I see is Snow. Maybe we are led to believe it’s Jon Snow, but what if it’s just Snow, the Vale Castle where Robert Arryn lives.
The Vale has been the last to join the fray, and so it is also one of the last houses in Westeros not extinct in the male line. Robyn Arryn is lightbringer. It also took Jon Arryn 3 tries to have a child, and his third wife also died and cried out “causing a crack in the face of the moon”- as in the moon door opening and falling through it.
I don’t see Robyn as heroic, which is likely why he’s been overlooked. But Baelish also really wanted to get his hands on him, and we know Petyr aims for the top rung of the ladder.
Furthermore, something is definitely off about Robert’s seizures. He also claims to hear the dead Marillion singing to him. What if Robyn Arryn is not a sickly boy, what if he’s a greenseer like Jojen Reed with his seizures and visions. He sits on a Weirwood throne in the Vale and their famous history says the warg king of the Vale married a child of the forest. What if, this whole time we’ve been looking for a hero, and it was just a boy. One perceived to be sick, weak, and with stunted emotional growth. It would be surprising, that’s for sure.
Addendum at request:
An argument for Robert Arryn possibly being a greenseer or warg like Jojen or Bran. One, he’s sickly like Bran and Jojen, and has seizures like Jojen. But take this curious event in the books that also occurs on the show:
In a Storm of Swords, Sansa begins to make a snow castle in the gardens of the Eyrie. 
“A pure world, Sansa thought. I do not belong here.” ...”at the center of the garden, beside the statue of the weeping woman that lay broken and half buried on the ground, she turned her face up to the sky and closed her eyes. She could feel the snow on her lashes m, taste it on her lips. It was the taste of Winterfell. The taste of innocence. The taste of dreams. When Sansa opened her eyes again, she was on her knees. She did not remember falling. It seemed to her that the sky was a lighter shade of grey. Dawn, she thought. Another new day. It was the old days she hungered for. Prayed for. But who could she pray to? The garden had meant for a godswood once, she knew, but the soil was too thin and stony for a weirwood to take root. A gods wood without gods, as empty as me”.
She then proceeds to elaborately build a snow castle, painstakingly identical to her memory of Winterfell. Petyr Baelish then interrupts and helps her build several parts and then kisses her. She makes several attempts to push him away and thinks about how nobody would save her, even Ser Lothor Brune. 
Suddenly, Lord Robert enters.
“Winterfell is the seat of House Stark”, Sansa told her husband to be. “The great castle of the north.”
“It’s not so great. The boy knelt before the gatehouse. “Look, here comes a giant to knock it down.” He stood his doll in the snow and moved it jerkily. “Tromp tromp I’m a giant, I’m a giant,” he chanted. “Hi ho ho, open your gates or I’ll mash them and smash them.” Swinging the doll by the legs, he knocked the top off one gatehouse tower and then the other.
It was more than Sansa could stand. “Robert, stop that”. Instead he swung the doll again, and a foot of wall exploded. She grabbed for his hand but she caught the doll instead. There was a large ripping sound as the thin cloth tore. Suddenly she had the dolls head, Robert had the legs and body, and the rag and sawdust stuffing was spilling in the snow. “Lord Roberts mouth trembled. “You killllllllled him,” he wailed. Then he began to shake. It started with no more than a little shivering, but with in a few short heartbeats he had collapsed across the castle, his limbs flailing about violently. White towers and snowy bridges shattered and fell on all sides.”

“A giant,” the boy whispered weeping. “It wasn’t me, it was a giant hurt the castle. She killed him! I hate her! She’s a bastard and I hate her! I don’t want to be leeched!”
My lord husband, Sansa thought, as she contemplated the ruins of Winterfell. A mad rage seized hold of her. She picked up a broken branch and smashed the torn dolls head dot on top of it, then pushed it down atop the shattered gatehouse of her snow castle. The servants looked aghast, but when little finger saw what she’d done he laughed. “If the tales be true, that’s not the first giant to end up with his head on Winterfell walls.”
“Those are only stories”, Sansa said and she left him there.

So let’s sum this up: in the Vale equivalent of a godswood without a tree, Sansa builds Winterfell with Petyr Baelish’s help, but pressing her for loving embraces. Robert interferes by using a giant to knock down the gatehouse, after which the rip apart the giant.
He then has a seizure and destroys the snow Winterfell. 
This sounds strangely and eerily similar to what happens to Winterfell on the show. The last giant breaks down the gates of Winterfell with Jon Snow and Tormund, only to be killed by multiple archers. And Robert seems oddly and childishly confused that he did something wrong, explaining that the giant did it, not him. Yes, he’s a churlish and immature boy, but the seizure is oddly prophetic as Jojens follow a similar pattern. And if it is prophetic, Winterfell is going to be completely destroyed in the upcoming season."
gottheories,7glfbb,Night King is the Hero of GoT?,44,11/30/2017 10:23,2017-48,10,"We have all heard that Bran is the Night King theory. For those of us who see its merit, then it is plausible to think that the Night King is the unsung hero. 

Bran has been warned not to linger in the past otherwise he might get lost in it. Say he doesn't take that advice and tries to stop the Night King from being created. Children of the forest not knowing Bran's intent, grab him and stick him with the dagger. He now is forced to live out thousands of years of history, history that he can already see with his greensight. Its the worst kind of prison, but he must play the role he knows the Night King is destined to play, otherwise he could irrevocably alter history. 

This would explain why the Night King knows so many thinga before the happen. Greensight does not give sight to the future. It would explain why Sam was spared by white walkers beyond the wall (because Sam would help Bran later). It would explain the striking facial similarities between the most recent casting of the Night King and Bran, as well as their expressionless demeanors. It would explain why the white walkers gave their fateful warning in the very first scene of the show.

The Night King is ultimately on the side of life, but he must play the villain for life to continue. He must kill and frighten the world so they believe he is a real threat. If they believe he is a threat, then they will band together to defeat him. Those who are on the side of life will fight, those who arent will die, but the world be rid of the wicked. The Night King wants the cycle of life to continue, but the Baelishs and the Cerseis of the world are going to bring it all to ruin like Valyria. He wants the wheel to keep turning, and we keep seeing the symbolism of cycles/circles. The wall comes down only to be rebuilt again. The wheel of the iron throne that Dany wants to ""break"" even though she is on the path of perpetuating it."
gottheories,66en7l,"How It All Ends (and boy, is it sad).....",45,4/20/2017 1:34,2017-16,15,"It's important to note George RR Martin is vehemently anti-war and was an adamant objector to the Vietnam intervention. Secondly, he blurs the lines between good and evil. The White Walkers are a metaphor for Weapons of Mass Destruction, or WMDs. They represent the threat that man is in danger of inflicting on themselves. The Children of the Forrest created them as a weapon of defense against men. Now, most of the COTF are wiped out. The WWs now want to destroy man. If that isn't symbolism for nuclear holocaust, I don't know what is.

However, the WWs also want something else.....

We know that they once arrived to a peace eight thousands years ago with the original Azor Ahai, and we know Craster reached an agreement with them, sacrificing his sons to them. This shows they can be reasoned with to a large extent.

Personally, I think they are responding to Jon's birth. The prevalence of WW sightings across the North spiked in the last fourteen years (Jon is this age when the story starts). There is some kind of fascination with Jon Snow.

You may know where I'm going with this. The only way this thing can end -

Is through Peace.

**Where It Ends**: The God's Eye, right where it all began thousands of years ago.

Some type of peace is brokered with the Walkers on the God's Eye, where I believe we see Howland Reed, one of the last green-seers, and Bran explaining to Jon what the walkers want.

What do the WWs want?

*They want to finally die*...

They didn't ask to be created, they just represent the physical manifestation of humans killing each other. Battered corpses.

I think dragon glass has something to do with it. In the show, we saw how the first walker was created with the shard being jammed into his chest.

Bran will tell Jon that he needs to pull it out of the Night's King, but that doings so would cause his death as well through fire. The NK will allow him to do so. Jon pulls it out of Night's King, and almost right away the surviving walkers all collapse into piles of dust.

Jon collapses and dies in the company of Davos Seaworth, Bran, Howland Reed, Thormund, and some other wildling survivors.

However, it's not quite done, yet....

Daenerys Targaryean will die. She won't turn mad like her father Aerys II Targaryean....But she also won't sit on the Iron Throne.

I think she dies in childbirth, to Jon's child, but Jon will never know she is pregnant.

She is not at the God's Eye during Jon's death, but knows of it because she dies after him - at Winterfell.

**Hear me out**....

**There's a pattern of childbirth deaths in this story. Dany's mother died giving birth to her. Jon's mother died giving birth to him. Tyrion's mother died giving birth to him**.

Dany won't survive this story. She has to die, failing to grab the Iron Throne, but giving life to their child.

And this child, like Jon Snow, will be a symbol of an ushering in of a new era.

One of the main reasons for Robert's Rebellion was the affair between Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark. Rhaegar never lived to see his son born. Jon won't either.

Jon himself represents the bridge of peace between two houses that were at war with each other - Stark & Targaryean.

This child will be the sword plunged into the heart of Azor Ahai's love, Nissa Nissa. **THE CHILD IS LIGHTBRINGER**.

Martin uses metaphors in his talks of visions, legendary folklore, etc. Lightbringer is not a literal sword.
Jon and Dany's deaths mirror that of Rhaegar and Lyanna.

In the end, when the peace is made, Westeros will pick up the pieces and rebuild itself from the ashes - the Iron Throne no longer existent, and the Seven Kingdoms broken up into independent states set up to self govern."
gottheories,6wgrqu,Theory: Tyrion is now working with Cercei,42,8/28/2017 3:12,2017-35,63,"Last night's season finale offered a number of reasons to suspect that the off-screen conclusion to Tyrion's private meeting w/Cersei was **not** what we — or indeed, any of the other characters — were led to believe.  Rather than successfully forging an unlikely alliance to fight the dead (as Dany was led to believe) or being some failure on Tyrion's part to recognize Cersei's deceptions (as Cersei herself would later characterize it), this meeting may have allowed the two Lannister siblings to reach the most unlikely deal of all: *a secret agreement to work together.*  

&nbsp;

Sound ridiculous?  These two *do* hate each other, for the most part.  And in addition to being given respect and power he never really had among his own at Dany's side, Tyrion *does* seem to have a pretty sincere belief that Danaerys could actually save the realm from itself.  But maybe take a page from Littlefinger's book and ask yourself first what both these characters might *really* want, deep down.  Then take a look at their actions in the episode and see if they fit such motives...

&nbsp;

Note that the writers spend *a lot* of time and dramatic energy in this episode emphasizing that Tyrion's innocent nephew and niece meant the world to him. They also reveal through his dialogue w/Cersei that the deepest and most painful feelings of guilt he now harbors stem from the possibility that his own actions were what led to their deaths.  Overall, it's a pretty weighty and revealing confession from someone who murdered both a father and ex-lover, among others.

&nbsp;

But importantly, it's also the exact way Cersei *has always wanted* Tyrion to feel w/respect to his guilt.  She rakes Tyrion over the coals for failing to see that the long-term of survival of the Lannister family as a whole was always much more important than his personal beef w/ Tywin, and points out that his murder of Tywin was what ultimately exposed her children to danger.  She goes on to emphasize that her own children have always been the only thing she ever really cared about -- an aspect of her character that Tyrion notably has always seen as her one good trait (""that and her cheekbones"").   

&nbsp;

This all builds up to a major turning point for Tyrion: his realization that Cersei is pregnant.  Based on their conversation up to this point, we're meant to understand why Tyrion would see this as his opportunity for **real** redemption: the chance to now (1) **protect an innocent niece or nephew**, as he failed to before, (2) **protect the future of the Lannister family**, as he failed to do before, and (3) still **protect the realm** by facilitating the temporary peace that would convince Dany to go north and fight the army of the dead.  While he might be sacrificing his honor to do so, this nicely completes his character arc -- a decision that contrasts w/ Jon's Stark-*ish* refusal to break an oath to save his people but mirrors his own brother Jamie's betrayal of King Aerys in order to save both his family and the innocents of Westeros.

&nbsp;
 
**Does this theory fit in with the rest of the episode?** I went over the relevant pieces of information we were given in this episode [in more detail on another site](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/6wml2y/theory_evidence_tyrion_is_now_working_with_cercei/) for those interested.  These other clues about what *really* went on in private between Tyrion and Cersei range from from subtle dialogue hints and foreshadowing to certain mysterious editing or performance choices that left viewers confused as to what was meant to be conveyed.  Examining these together, its clear that Tyrion's decision to betray Danaerys by teaming up w/ Cersei could at least put into context a lot of otherwise confusing or unexplained moments from this episode.  **For instance**:

&nbsp;

+ **The private meeting.**  If Cersei did not need Tyrion, why would she go through the charade of refusing to help at first and meeting w/ him privately?  It would have made more sense to just act overwhelmed/scared into wanting to fight after seeing the wight; having the meeting just looked suspicious.  And speaking of **suspiciousness** -- Tyrion for his part had no real reason to risk death by meeting *alone* with Cercei as he argued to do (there were plenty of Dothraki around to roll with him, for instance) -- unless of course he (a) thought he had something of actual value to offer Cersei, and (b) needed to offer it in total privacy.  

&nbsp;

+ **Cersei herself explained why she needs a spy.**  During the negotiations, Cersei may have actually hinted herself at what Tyrion could offer her of value, stating almost explicitly that she needed some sort of spy in Danaerys' inner circle before she could agree to a temporary truce. According to Cersei, the thing getting in the way of a truce was that she would have no way of knowing for sure if Dany's army was actually moving north if she couldn't actually ""see"" what it was doing for herself.  This would have likely alerted Tyrion to the fact that a temporary peace was possible if -- but maybe **only** if -- Cersei had an insider serving as her eyes.

&nbsp;

+ **Cersei's statement that Jamie is 'the dumbest Lannister' for not realizing that lying to Dany was the best option.**  This suggests that in contrast, both she and Tyrion ultimately saw eye-to-eye on this strategy as a means of protecting the family.

&nbsp;

+ **Cersei's conclusion that ""something must have happened"" to one of Dany's dragons in the north.**  If she is willing to risk the outcome of a war on this conclusion, it makes a lot more sense that Tyrion shared this fact with her.  Otherwise, it's just a guess on her part — especially given that she had no real reason to know that Dany was even involved in the northern expedition. 

&nbsp;

+  **Tyrion's strange reaction to Dany and Jon's hook-up at the end of the episode.**  Its hard to imagine that he's actually jealous or otherwise disturbed by their getting together, as some suggest.  He never did anything before to dissuade her from this impending romance, after all -- and even joked about it with Dany.  Rather, this seems like the look of a recently-committed traitor now reflecting on what he may be destroying through his betrayal.  

&nbsp;

Ultimately, I guess it comes down to how we see Tyrion.  If we believe that Tyrion's deepest feelings of guilt speak to his central motivations as a character -- as they seem to in the book -- then his decision to betray Dany and agree to spy for Cersei makes overall sense.  The opportunity to be useful to and respected by a potential ruler he personally believes in certainly offers him a great deal -- even a chance at real happiness, which seems to elude almost everyone in this world.  But it would never really allay the guilt that has become such a core element of his character -- something I think he understands himself by the end of Season 7.  Cersei, for her part, declines to kill Tyrion for the same basic reason: hate him though she might, she still sees her own emotions as secondary to the fact that Tyrion might be able to protect her last chance at a family by spying on Dany or swaying her views.  I’m curious to see if he ultimately succeeds in doing either -- and unsure meanwhile if I even *want* him to.  But at this point, I’m just impressed to think he’s giving it a shot.

I recently went back and watched S06E03 of GOT, and came up with a theory after watching the famous ""Tower of Joy"" battle.

Obviously, I am referring to the part where Bran calls ""father!"", and it appears that young Ned hears him, and turns around.

Here's my theory... which is predicated on the fact that R+L=J is true.

On the way up to the Tower of Joy, young Ned hears Bran's call through the space-time continuum. It sounds distant, perhaps at the time he even mistakes it for the sound of the wind. He then proceeds to climb the tower to where Lyanna has just given birth to a baby boy... The rest of the R+L=J theory is well known, and I won't regurgitate it; however, my theory is that after Ned promises Lyanna to keep Jon's parentage a secret, he remembers what he thought he heard... ""Father"". On the long, lonely ride home he decides to pass Jon as his son, as if it called to him.

I'm not sure if this is an original theory, but I hope you enjoy!"

The prophecy tells us Cersei will die at the hands of a younger brother. She believes this to be Tyrion and many viewers hypothesise that Jamie will eventually intentionally kill her. I think there's a third option. Cersei  won't give birth to a live child as the prophecy only granted her three children. I think in a cyclical twist of fate Cersei will die giving birth to a dwarf like her mother. Only this time neither the mother or the child survive. Given Jamie is her brother and impregnated her, he will have inadvertently killed her. "

&#x200B;

The Night King accepts Crastors babies as a sacrifice. There are rumors that Crastor has old blood in his veins. The long night 8000 years before the white walkers made a deal with Azor Ahai, but we know not what. Another tale from that time was about ""The prince that was promised"", so maybe, just maybe the deal was:

A Stark and a Targaryan (Azor Ahai and Nessa Nessa) ruled the seven kingdoms, the night king was fighting them but every side wanted peace. So they made a deal, they said: ""Hey you turn back to the north and you will get our firstborn son, so you will have the heir to the kingdom."", That was 'the Prince that was promised'

&#x200B;

This makes a lot of sense. The ending was always going to be bittersweet. So Danaerys finally births a child, maybe dying doing so. And the night king demands the ""Prince that was promised"". Jon and his team wins the throne but the night king now has the true heir to the iron throne and when Jon and Danny dies either by old age (since that doesn't seem to affect the white walkers) or by battle, the night king will present the heir, and HE would be the winner of ""A game of Thrones""...

Then it dawned on me that Euron is going to Essos to pick up the Golden Company and ferry them to Westeros.

My guess is that Theon somehow manages to sink Euron's fleet, whether by wildfire, blowing up powder kegs, or some other means, and will singlehandedly (with a few Iron Islanders of course) prevent Cersei's plot.

He may even give a heroic sacrifice to stop Euron. It'll be interesting to see how this might be executed but it makes sense to me as the likely culmination of Theon's arc and his major contribution to the story."

Guld presents...
#The Solution to the Riddle of Ice and Fire

After extensive review of the prophecies in the book, review of the original 1993 Story Pitch by George RR Martin, and MANY careful critical rewatchings of the TV Show, I think I can finally explain EVERYTHING that will happen in Season 8.
I think I finally solved the Riddle of Ice and Fire.

I will TRY to go over this as quickly as possible. If requested, I'll try to explain the details a bit further (If I can).

The key for me was the last couple of TV episodes. A few key things happened.....Tyrion had a hidden conversation with Cersei, Viscerion died, and Jon and Dany slept together and LIKELY made a baby.

So I think Season 8 will pick up a few month from where we left off. We will get the sense that the war against the undead has been going back and forth. The other thing to note will be that Cersei and Dany will be quite a few months pregnant. 

#1. Tyrion Betrays Dany and Jon the first time...(Dany and Melisandre die)

-Tyrion will fulfill Dany's Treason for Love. He will betray her for the ""Love"" of his own family. 

-Tyrion will set up some level of betrayal to try and remove Dany and Jon from power so that he can assume control of their army and unite it with Cersei's. 

-My BEST guess for how this plays out: Dany is killed by the faceless assassin (Missandei) and Rezzed by Melisandre. Jon keeps his word though, and executes Mel after, despite her saving his wife and child. 

#2. Tyrion Betrays Dany and Jon the second time...(Jon and Rhaegal die)

-My BEST guess is Tyrion and Varys convince Dany to seek peace with Cersei or indicate that she has requested to discuss terms with them. So Jon actually rides Rhaegal to either Kings Landing, or possibly Casterly Rock. This is an ambush though. Both Rhaegal and Jon are slaughtered. Jon doesn't come back this time.

#3. Dany kills Varys

-Dany won't know that it was Tyrion that betrayed her, and she will mistakenly assume it was Varys. Varys will be executed/burned.

#4. Tyrion starts descending into Madness...

-Tyrion will feel horrible for having to kill one of his best friends Jon Snow(Aegon Targaryen). He will question if anything is worth this level of lies and deceit. 

#5. Euron's Fleet Defeated

-At some point Theon will rescue Yara/Asha...or at the very least Euron's fleet will either be stopped before it gets to Essos, or the fleet will be destroyed before it reaches Westeros.

-The importance of this will be that Cersei will NOT get her extra ground forces.

#6. Bran tries to stop the Night King/Bran becomes the Night King

-Bran will warg into the past and try and stop the man (likely a Stark named Brandon) from becoming the Night King in the first place. 

-The Children of the Forest will tie him up and gag him.

-Bran won't be able to Warg 100% out in time, and will realize that his Warging into the man is actually what gave the Night King his Undead Warging power. So Bran actually kinda IS the Night King.

#7. The Last Hero will kill the Night King

-Jaime and Brienne will be part of the Northern Alliance and be fighting the undead on the front lines with their DragonSteel.

-At some point Jaime will have a moment to charge the Night King. 

-This will play out almost exactly as the show moment where Jaime charged Dany and Drogon.

-Only THIS time, Jaime will burst THROUGH the flames and kill the Night King AKA Bran.

-The undead, and White Walkers will all perish, but Jaime will be turned to ash.  His only remains will be his sword and a flaming golden hand. (This was foreshadowed when Jojen told Bran that ""This isn't the end, not for you."" and when Meera asked how they will know the end he just looked at his right hand on fire and said ""You'll know"".

-The Night King will be killed by the KingSlayer.

-Brienne will look over him and likely say something like ""I swore an oath to protect him...""

#8. Assault on Kings Landing

-With the undead army defeated, all attention goes south to Kings Landing and Cersei.

-All of the Northern Army will march south.

-Just like the last rebellion, the Lannisters will open the gates, they will even march out of Kings Landing and appear to be heading back to Casterly Rock. They will point back to the Red Keep. ""She's all yours"". Even the Mountain will be seen marching away.

-The Ground forces will march up to the Red Keep and will start smashing down the doors.

-Dany will spot Cersei atop the Red Keep and will grow impatient.

-With all the archers/army gone, Dany will fly her dragon up to the top of the Red Keep and she will command Drogon to burn Cersei.

-BUT once Dany get's closer she will realize that it's NOT Cersei, it's her handmaiden in disguise.

-The Red Keep and most of Kings Landing will explode in Wild Fire.

#9. Drogon Dies

-The debris from the explosion will cause Drogon to die. He will set down inside the throne room before passing.

-Dany will re-live her vision from the House of the Undying. She will walk towards the Iron Throne (which now has snow falling on it) but she won't take it. 

-The trauma of losing Jon, Rhaegal, and now Drogon, will be too much for her and she will start bleeding between her legs.

-NOTE: It might happen that Dany and Drogon will both be engulfed in Fire and Dany will walk out unharmed but Drogon won't make it.

#10. Dany Dies

-Of the remaining ground forces that weren't killed in the wild fire explosion, Jorah and possibly Sam will find Dany.

-Dany will be bleeding badly and dying. I don't know if she will be rushed away anywhere (like a tower) but regardless, nobody else will be around and she will order Jorah to help save her baby.

-Jorah will likely perform a C-Section...or at the very least help deliver the baby.

-Dany will hold the baby and will whisper something into Jorah's ear.

-Jorah will pick up the baby and Dany will die.

-Jorah will carry the baby away and he will tell everyone that Dany has died and that he wasn't able to save the baby.

#11. Cersei's Final Stand

-Cersei and her Lannister army will either be at Casterly Rock...maybe the final battle will be at Harrenhall? I'm not 100% sure. Regardless, due to the culling of the Northern Forces by the WildFire bait at KingsLanding, and the defence of a castle/keep it will be a near even battle.

-The Northern Alliance is now led by Sansa and they will realize that Tyrion is missing and is reportedly with Cersei.

-Battle ensues and Sansa's Army will win. Cersei, Tyrion, and The Mountain will all be holed up and will eventually be forced to surrender.

#12. The Rebuild 

-Time passes, everyone is rebuilding. 

-We learn that Sansa is now Queen of Westeros. 

-Brienne is the Lord Commander of the QueensGuard, she will fill out Jaime's page in the Lord Commander book with a smile on her face, proud of everything that he did. 

-Bran will be declared/forced to be Lord of Winterfell..and it looks like Meera is on her way to becoming Lady of Winterfell. Afterall, a Stark must always be in Winterfell. 

-Gendry will likely be legitimized and be Lord of Storm's End

-Theon or Asha/Yara will be Lord/Lady of Pyke

#13. The War Trial

-The Final War Trial will happen....most characters will be in attendance for this. Sansa will be sitting over the trial and Bran will be by her side.

-Cersei and Tyrion will come out in shackles. Possibly shackled together. Cersei will be VERY pregnant by this point. 

-Cersei will be up first, she will be accused of her crimes but she will retort with something along with ""Sheep can't judge a Lion, only the Gods can judge me. I choose trial by combat."" She will choose the Mountain as her Champion and he will be retrieved from the prison cells.

-Sansa will look over the crowd and the Hound will step forward. Which will lead to...

#14. CLEGANEBOWL!

-The fight will be fantastic, and the Hound will likely win. Cersei will be told that she will be executed immediately after the trial.

#15. Tyrion's Trial

-Tyrion will be told of the crimes he is accused of. Tyrion will explain that he has been tormented and cursed ever since he committed his first true crime. When he becamse a kinslayer and killed his own father. He will explain that everything he did was to redeem himself to his family somehow, and protecting his future niece/nephew was the only way he could do it.

-Bran will chime in ""Tywin wasn't your father.""

-At first Tyrion will be very relieved. That means that he ISN'T a kinslayer. He ISN'T the monster he always thought he was.

-Then Bran will reveal that his father was actually Aerys Targaryen. 

-Tyrion will break down. That means that he actually betrayed and was resonsible for the deaths of his half-sister (Dany), his half-nephew (Jon), and their child.

#16. The Valonqar Prophecy

-As Tyrion is freaking out, Cersei will make some comment that ignites him. Probably something like ""I knew a disgusting dwarf like you couldn't be my true brother"" or ""you still killed our mother"". Whatever it is, he will lash out at Cersei and strangle her with the shackles around his arms. He will scream at her until she stops breathing. Cersei thought the prophecy was broken and stopped fearing Tyrion when she had her 4th baby....but she never delivered the baby and was killed by the Valonqar/Younger Brother.

#17. The Fate of Tyrion

-I think Sansa will be disgusted with Tyrion and his actions but will give him one last chance at redemption, which Tyrion will take.

-He will take the black. His final shot will be staring off The Wall (which is being rebuilt again).
 
-He will finally be able to ""brood"" as well as Jon.

#18. Sam and Arya Leave

-Arya will turn down the chance to finally be a ""Knight"" in the Queensguard. Instead she will travel West to see what is West of Westeros.

-Sam will return to the Citadel and will make some comment to the other Maesters how it will take him a long time to write these event down. Some cheesy line about calling it ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" or ""A Game of Thrones"".

#19. The Great Other...Jon and Dany's Baby

-The Final scene will be of Jorah. He is somewhere warm...likely with Lemon Trees haha. (EDIT: Or possibly DragonStone...)

-He is holding a child, it's Jon and Dany's baby. It's alive and well....BUT....since both of the child's parent's had died and were brought back to life using Fire/Blood Magic....something isn't quite right...

-We look closer at the child, and it's eyes are the same design and pattern as The Night's King, but instead of glowing Blue, the eyes are glowing Red. After all, he isn't the NightKing...he is LightBringer!


#LightBringer/Azor Ahai Explained

-Who is Azor Ahai: Both Jon and Dany are Azor Ahai

-The key for the prophecy was this season when Viscerion died.

-To forge LightBringer, the Azor Ahai did the following...

-1) Forge the Sword/Child in Water (Viscerion)

-2) Forge thd Sword/Child in Heart of Lion (Rhaegal)

-3) Forge the Sword/Child that is loved most (Drogon)

From the Flames The Red Sword/Blood Covered Child shall be born. Beneath the bleeding star (the cuts on Dany may make it look like a star) amidst Smoke (from dead Drogon/WildFire) and Salt (Dany's tears). It will be called LightBringer, and whoever carries it (Dany...partly Jon) will be the Azor Ahai.

#Why did the White Walkers/Night King head south...

-Because they had to stop the creation of the ""Great Other"". Their return happened at the same time that Jon and Dany were born. 

-From the side of ""Ice and Darkness"" the ""Great Other"" is one of ""Fire and Light"".

-Melisandre worships Fire and Light, so she views the ""Great Other"" as Bran AKA Night King.

-The Night King viewed LightBringer as the ""Great Other"" and began the march south to stop it.

-That is why they call it ""Other(s)"" it's just the OTHER side of the coin.

Anyway, I know that's a LOT to take in. 
I'm obviously open to discussion, is there anything I missed? I think there is probably a bit of wiggle room, but overall I think I got everything.

#Thanks
Thanks to George RR for this great story!

Thanks to the TV Show for bringing it to life!

and Thank you for taking the time to read everything I just wrote.

gottheories,afx5b0,Free will doesn't exist in Game of Thrones,36,1/14/2019 15:57,2019-3,17,"So, it’s already been established that time travel in Game of Thrones follows a loop structure. Bran learned this from the Three-Eyed Raven. Events that happened in the past, such as Hodor losing his mind, and Ned hearing a voice at the foot of the Tower of Joy, were caused by events in the future.

Now, this creates a logical problem. There has to have been a time when Ned didn't hear anything and Hodor didn't have a seizure. In turn, Bran has to have been born to reach the future to do it all at least once. This is the time travel paradox.

So, we have several different types of time travel tropes, and it’s important to be clear on what Game of Thrones is using or appears to be using. In Terminator, when you time travel, you're creating alternate timelines. In Back To The Future, you're destroying an existing timeline to create a new one because their logic dictates that two cannot exist. Game of Thrones uses the loop structure where time is a sequence of predetermined events that always repeats itself, like in HP: The Prisoner of Azkaban.

I recently watched a movie called Arrival, which solves the paradox of the loop I mentioned earlier by detaching the events of the film from the constraints of our conventional understanding of time. We're liberated from a linear perception where the future is a different thing to the past because we're given an omniscient perspective where the past, present, and future are all combined into one, and they no longer require a start point because both ends of the loop are being drawn at the same time. Arrival explains it as “palindromic”, like the name Hannah. It doesn't matter which way you read that name it still says, Hannah. Game of Thrones will probably take a similar direction.

This can be hard to wrap your head around, but what it comes down to is that everything is predetermined, nothing falls out of the experience of the time loop. If you were to restart the GoT universe over and over, Jon will always be a bastard, Jon will always know nothing, Ned will always die, Arya will always hate knitting, and Geoffrey will always be a dick. Jojen, The Three-Eyed Raven, Melisandre, Bran and many others have experienced this to some extent. They all had visions of the past, present and future, and Melisandre said it was unclear which one she saw at any given time. Interestingly, this is Jojen’s house sigil:

\[url=[https://imgbb.com/\]\[img\]](https://imgbb.com/][img])[https://i.ibb.co/tqgZmbh/250px-Reed-coat-of-arms.png\[/img\]\[/url\]](https://i.ibb.co/tqgZmbh/250px-Reed-coat-of-arms.png[/img][/url])

If you look far enough into the past, you realise that it all has a very coincidental nature; the Targs bois were tipped off to the doom of Valyria by a vision of the future, allowing them to escape. Without the Targs there would be no Aegon's conquest, no Mad King, and no Robert's Rebellion. We can also see evidence of a suspiciously cycle-like nature with the red comet, the seasons, and The Long Night. If time is a loop, then the future is already written, “the ink is dry”. Events in A Song Of Ice And Fire, such as Robert's rebellion, The Long Night, Ned's execution, every spring, summer, autumn and winter and what Jon had for dinner will happen every single time in the same order without fail. The implications of this are that none of the characters have, what we would describe as ""free will"".

What does it mean if the character’s motivations, whims and desires are not their own? The more and more I think about this I realise that it could all be psychologically symbolic of materialism. Primarily in the west, we believe in dualism, the mind and body as two opposing concepts. Materialism is the theory that humans are entirely physical beings and governed by the laws of physics, which govern every action and reaction in the universe. A sense of ""free will"" is not compatible with materialism because it presupposes that we are not in the driving seat. Our mind is subject to natural laws and isn’t separate from the body. One gets the sense that the time loop in Game of Thrones is incompatible with free will, in turn, dualism.

It would make sense for Martin to incorporate Sci-Fi elements into the story, as his earlier works were in that genre, and many authors use themes from contemporary psychology to inspire and give depth to their writing.

Long winded...

Evidence for an idea like this would be hard to come by for obvious reasons, but some interesting ideas that seem to be of a similar vein are from the fandom wiki:

*“Tyrion's prolonged discussion of Orson Lannister, their drooling cousin, lasts nearly four minutes in ""The Mountain and the Viper"". The writers explained in the Inside-the-Episode featurette that they intended that when faced with his probable death, Tyrion's mind is wandering to question why seemingly random acts of brutality happen in the world and that he saw Orson smashing beetles as a sort of microcosm of this question. The analogy is that if Orson was an almighty force inflicting death and destruction on insects, if there is a higher power inflicting death and destruction on human beings - whatever god, gods, ""nature"", or ""fate"" this power may be - Tyrion would at least feel better knowing there was some underlying reason that went into causing such brutality. He also wouldn't be particularly upset if there are no higher powers, and bad things truly happen at random. But Tyrion felt that Orson wasn't acting randomly, some sort of decision-making process was going into his actions, though he could not discern it: what frightens Tyrion is that some unknown, but still reasoning thing or cosmic powers are intentionally directing people towards death and destruction, yet all of our attempts to comprehend why they are doing this (even a simple reason like ""hate"") are in vain.”*

And this is from Art of The Title:

*“A fiery astrolabe orbits high above a world not our own; its massive Cardanic structure sinuously coursing around a burning center, vividly recounting an unfamiliar history through a series of heraldic tableaus emblazoned upon it. An intricate map is brought into focus as if viewed through some colossal looking glass by an unseen custodian. Cities and towns rise from the terrain, their mechanical growth driven by the gears of politics and the cogs of war.""*

I’ll leave you with this:

*Varys*

*Three great men sit in a room: A king, a priest, and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword; each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives? Who dies?*

*Tyrion*

*Depends on the sellsword.*

*Varys*

*Does it? He has neither crown, nor gold, nor favour with the gods.*

*Tyrion*

*He has a sword. The power of life and death.*

*Varys*

*Then if it’s swordsmen who rule why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The Executioner? Or something else…*

gottheories,awaqw8,Bran is NOT the Night King. There is no Present in time.,35,3/1/2019 22:44,2019-9,12,"Alright hear me out here because it is a little confusing.  The premise is that there is only one timeline in this show and everything that is going to happen is set/can not be changed.

While Bran was learning from the three eyed raven he was told “the past is written, the ink is dry”.  What this means is that everything that Bran does in the future to alter the past has already happened and is in effect. 

As an example: What happened to Hodor.  The fact that Hodor’s mind is scrambled the entire time before we actually see Bran go back in time and mess him up ( up until episode 5 in season 6) means that the future has already happened and is set in stone.  From the second that Walder (Hodor’s real name) became Hodor that specific series of events had to play out exactly the way it did or Bran would never have been in that exact situation... think the butterfly effect. 

Soo if you’re still with me the fact that the Night King is alive and well in the present means that nothing Bran does in the future to try to alter the past will work against the Night King because he would already be dead if it had worked. 

The OG three eyed raven understood this concept based on the quote listed earlier.  To bring it all together Bran would be stupid to try and go back in time to warg into the Night King because if it had worked he wouldn’t have this issue in the first place.  

So I don’t think Bran goes back in time and becomes the Night King.  He may go back in time to try and discover his motive or to learn more about him but I can’t see him intentionally going back in time to try to directly stop him (if he understands this concept).  



"
gottheories,avyun3,Bran will get killed in the present and it will trap him while he is warging into the man who becomes the night king,32,3/1/2019 1:31,2019-9,23,"I believe that Bran will try to stop the Night Kong from being made and will warg back to the time he saw when the children stuck the dagger into the man who becomes the night king. I believe they will be attacked while he is doing this and Bran will die while warging and that will trap him in the past. 

This is how the Night King knows everything that will happen. I think there were sleeping under the ice until John was born and that’s what put everything in motion. I believe he knows that Jon will ultimately kill the Night King so he plays everything out that he has seen. "
gottheories,ajvpbf,The wall didn't fall... yet,36,1/26/2019 0:26,2019-4,3,"Just rewatched the whole series again in anticipation for season 8. And it seems pretty obvious to me that the wall didn't fall... yet. Bran was having a vision of the future. Maybe not a far off future, but still. We've seen him have visions of the future before, (i.e. when Cersei blew up the Sept of Baelor), and he was warging into a raven to watch it happen. Or so they want us to think... he wasn't really warging. They never show the raven's eyes going white, just Bran and then a flock of ravens. It was a premonition. 

Also, he saw this while Jon and Dany were on their way back to Winterfell and some of the promo video shows their arrival and no one seems to be panicking that the wall was breached. Even if word hadn't come from Eastwatch, Bran ""saw"" it happen, surely he would have said something a lot sooner than the time it took them to get there. So wouldn't everyone be preparing for the NK & the WW and not wasting time on formally welcoming Dany to Winterfell?

If it did really happen, why show Bran having a vision at the tree right before that scene?

gottheories,aicaz6,Final battle location against the Night King?,34,1/21/2019 17:23,2019-4,16," 

Season 4 Episode 5 First of His Name

While taking Sanza to the Eerie and walking towards the Bloody Gate Lord Peter Baelish says the following:

Sanza, ""Is this the only way into the Eerie?""

Peter, ""The mountains are impassable. **It doesn't matter how large your army is**, if you attack the Eerie you come marching down this road to the Bloody Gate, three men abreast, and get slaughtered like goats.

The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them. **And the fortress they built here has never been overcome, not once not in a thousand years**. Know your strengths use them wisely and one man can be worth ten thousand.""

I made this account just to post this.

Anyone else get the feeling the Eerie may be the final battle location against the Night King? Any thoughts?"

The Hound will become a ""Red Priest"".
He has been touched (more like slapped) by flame at a young age and he keeps getting in contact with Thoros and Beric. He also had some kind of divinatory experience through induced fire-gazing.
Now that Thoros is gone he will ""replace"" him (maybe unwillingly and/or unconsciously) becoming a new ""bonus life generator"" for Beric and stuff."
gottheories,b42758,"Theory: Jaime is azor ahai, and Bran's trump card in his fight against the NK",33,3/22/2019 7:45,2019-12,7,"So, this theory is based on a few deductions and some show evidence. 

First is that Bran is the target that the NK is after. I think this is the most likely since the wights came after him when bran was touched by the NK in a vision. I don't think a resolution with the NK can come without him being integral to defeating him. The night king went out of his way to kill the 3-eyed raven and there has to be a greater reason for that then coincidence, right?

Second, is that Jaime is on the path of redemption, and he can never achieve that until he makes it up to the people that he harmed most, which is the starks, and specifically Bran.

Theory: I think in the trailer that the one Bran is speaking to when he says ""everything you did brought you to where you are now"" is a line he will give to Jaime. Jaime is headed to winterfell to tell them of cersei's betrayal, and Jaime will have to meet Bran there. I think it will make sense that Jaime stays with the starks because thats where Brienne will be, and brienne is defending Sansa. Sansa will need convincing, and Bran who knows all about what is going on is the perfect character to talk to about that. A conflict and resolution between the two is almost surely going to happen at some point here. I think in the conversation that Jaime will promise to fight for the living to make up for his previous wrongs.

If Bran's biggest conflict is the NK, and Jaime's biggest obstacle for redemption is making it up to the Starks, and specifically bran, how can he do that? Well, by becoming Bran's champion and helping him defeat the NK. It would be practically poetic. He starts out as the biggest enemy of the starks, he pushes Bran out a window, fights Ned, leads an army against Rob, only to become Bran's Champion.

What does that mean to become Bran's champion? I think that will mean that Bran will have to figure out the Azor Ahai prophecy as the one to end the long winter. If anyone can discern the prophecy of Azor Ahai, its the guy that can see into the past, and the guy that has spent all of last season researching about how to stop the NK, which is Sam, and he is conveniently going to be arriving in winterfell to have a chance to meet Bran soon. No way does the show make so much hay over the Azor Ahai prophecy and then never address it again in the final hour when they will need it the most. Also, melisandre will be likely at winterfell soon, and she is very invested in the Azor Ahai prophecy. No doubt, if the prophecy is to become relevant again someone will need to step up soon as a candidate and she will be one to talk about it.

I'm still not sure if the prince who was promised and azor ahai are the same or different people though. It could certainly turn out that Jon is the prince who is promised while Jaime is Azor Ahai and they fight the NK together. I just thought this was a really interesting theory on how both of their characters could end their story in a satisfying way.~"
gottheories,anybr8,"Rhaegar Married Elia Martell Without his Father's Blessing so that he could have a child that was a ""Dragon""",36,2/7/2019 1:32,2019-6,23,"Prince Rhaegar was considered extremely bookish from a very young age and only took up fighting after reading something that convinced him that he needed to.

I think that Rhaegar was trying to roll back the curse that had caused the Targaryen line to include ""dragons"". In this case these ""dragons"" would be those Targaryen children who were found immune to heat and fire, could hatch real dragon eggs and could help real dragons to flourish and grow large and strong.

In his reading, Rhaegar realized that the Targaryen inbreeding was the cause of the decline of such births. Because of this, he (not his father) rejected marriage to one of his cousins, providing his father with the excuse that they were not of noble enough birth.

After the birth of his son Aegon (who was a dragon) his wife Elia was no longer able to bear children. I think that this usually happens when a dragon is born. The exception would be when the mother is also a dragon she may withstand the fire of the birth.

His wife Elia unable to have more children he determined to win the heart of Lyanna Stark, marry her, and have another ""dragon"" with her.

Ser Bonifer Hasty could also be Rhaegar's father. Since I suspect that both Rhaegar and his mother Rhaella are dragons and it would make more sense if Rhaegar was not the product of inbreeding. Rhaegar's mother Rhaella and King Aerys II were very unhappy in their marriage and Rhaella was in love with Ser Bonifer Hasty, though her father made her marry her brother Aerys instead.


My Theoretical List of Targaryen Dragons:

- Aegon V (Egg) ~ son of Prince Maekar Targaryen and Dyanna Dayne (not-inbred)

- Shaera Targarye ~ daughter of King Aegon V Targaryen and Queen Betha Blackwood (not-inbred)

- Queen Rhaella Targaryen ~ daughter of Queen Shaera Targaryen and speculatively a non-Targaryen after Shaera found her sickly husband/brother Jaehaerys II unable to get her pregnant again.

- Prince Rhaegar Targaryen ~ son of Queen Rhaella Targaryen and  Ser Bonifer Hasty

- Aegon Targaryen ~ son of Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and Elia Martell

- Jon Snow (birth name Aegon Targaryen)  son of Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark

- Daenerys Targaryen ~ daughter of Queen Rhaella Targaryen and another who is not Aerys II. Maybe Tywin Lannister sought her out as revenge for Aerys raping his wife Joanna. Rhaella would likely be open to another relationship since she did not love Aerys.

- Tyrion Lannister ~ Son of King Aerys II and Joanna Lannister by rape. Tyrion is a dragon, but misformed since neither his mother or father were a dragon, his father is a descendant of a dragon and the gene skipped that generation.


This theory might have some holes, but there is also a lot more supporting evidence that I've found.


TLDR: Rhaegar had children with non-Targaryen women because he thought it the only way to have children that would be ""dragons"" His mother knew this, and her grandfather knew it too.

gottheories,8e85tk,Drogon is both Azor Ahai and the Stallion who will mount the world,36,4/23/2018 2:23,2018-17,6,"Frankly I think it is amazing how little I have seen this theory posted. Drogon fulfils almost all the criteria needed for a character to be both of these prophesied heros. 

I believe when Danaeryes' baby was killed by the witch he did not just die as a sacrifice to wake the dragon eggs, but became one of the dragons (perhaps all three). Dany frequently calls the dragons her children even when others don't understand what she means. I believe that Drogon is in some form actually her son. Not that she gave birth to him but that her sons spirit went into the egg, perhaps similar to a warg after they die. If this is true which I don't think is impossible the argument becomes even stronger. Even without this fact drogon appears to be the prophesied hero.

He fits almost all the criteria to be Azor Ahai 

Drogon was literally born under the red comet, unlike other major candidates.

He was born under the smoke from his fathers funeral pyre and salt from his mothers tears

No character has a potential lightbringer anything as close as Drogon. Drogon can breathe fire as a weapon whenever he wishes. The most literal flaming sword of all the candidates.

Being Dany's child he is descended from Aerys Targarion. This is pretty clear.

Drogon with his two siblings are the 3 heads of the dragon.

The nissa nissa part of the prophesy is yet to occur, but it is not unlikely that this will reveal itself at some stage.

The only other part of the prophecy is that Azor Ahai will have something to do with stone dragons arising. Drogon is literally the personification of stone dragons awakening.

So Drogon could be Azor Ahai, he has just as much going for him (if not more) than all the other candidates. Almost all that attributes Dany to being Azor Ahai is usually in relation to the dragons.

But the legend of this prophesied hero spans many cultures and prophesies. Danareies was specifically told that her child would be the stallion that would mount the world.

The stallion that mounts the world would unite all the khals into a single Khalifate. He will lead the dothraki to the ends of the earth. Now together Drogon and Dany have done this, I say together because neither was able to do it without the other. Drogon dropped dany in the Dothraki sea and was Danys mount or stallion. Remember, dragons aren't just beasts they are intelligent and wise, perhaps more than people. It could have been Drogons plan to do this. Even if it wasn't, he still made it happen.

But let's look at the actual prophecy about the stallion.

""As swift as the wind he rides, and behind him his khalasar covers the earth, men without number, with arakhs shining in their hands like blades of razor grass. Fierce as a storm this prince will be. His enemies will tremble before him, and their wives will weep tears of blood and rend their flesh in grief. The bells in his hair will sing his coming, and the milk men in the stone tents will fear his name. The prince is riding, and he shall be the stallion who mounts the world.""

This is such a clear description of a dragon. He is riding the wind, as fierce as a storm, even men in castles will fear him. We all know Harrenhall the greatest castle didn't stand a chance against dragons. 

Also in this prophecy the stallion is also described as a prince. Not only is this a connection to the prince that was promised but also that Drogon is the son of a queen. It is also unlikely Drogon will ever succeed his mother, as he is a dragon, so he will forever be a prince not a king. 

The prophecy says that they will be both a stallion and a prince. This seems like an odd duality. Except in the case of Drogon as he is both Danys child and her mount. 

If Drogon is the fulfilment of the prophecy, it does not mean that he is the only hero. In all of GOT, prophecies are great red herrings. While true they are distracting you from the actual thing you should be focusing on. Drogon has been right in front of us this whole time, he is the prophesied one. But not he only hero in the story.

If Littlefinger was dead for good, he would have no reason not to negate the theory on the spot and say that his character is dead for good; as we literary saw him die on screen. It's not as if his character was not shown to die as Stannis or the Hound in which case there was probable reason not to deny or confirm their deaths.

Aidan Gillen is as ingenious as the very character he plays! 

And one final thing: In the latest interview he even let us know subtly that he knows the ending to Game of Thrones. And how would he know the ending if he isn't in the final season as only the cast members involved in the final season know how GoT ends.

gottheories,a1lvdu,The Seven Deadly Sins and the End of the Series,32,11/29/2018 21:54,2018-48,5,"After rewatching most of the show and many analysis videos I’ve come up with a two-pronged theory, one about how the families of Game of Thrones represent The Seven Deadly Sins and also about the White Walkers and how the show is going to end, but I’ll get to that later.

Part of what makes GoT so entertaining is that there really are no good guys or bad guys in this show. Everybody is oftentimes a flawed selfish asshole in their own way. There are some biblical undertones to the story as well, which isn’t surprising. George R.R. Martin has said he draws a lot of inspiration from Tolkien in fantasy and writing, and Tolkien’s work in LOTR/The Hobbit had many biblical themes and undertones, & A Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones is no different. My theory on the TV show stems from this, I believe that each of the major houses in the show represents one of the Seven Deadly Sins, and on a greater scale shows just how corrupt people in this world have become, which plays into the end of the show.

&#x200B;

**Greed: House Tyrell**. The Tyrells are a compelling family, especially because they seem to be the only matriarchal family in Westeros, and the alpha women of this family play the Game of Thrones with great cunning. However, their greatest flaw throughout the show is greed for power, and ultimately it led to their downfall. They showed a complete lack of loyalty to anybody in The War of Five Kings, siding first with Renly Baratheon, later switching sides to secure a partnership with the Lannisters in a military alliance, then through Margaery marrying Joffrey/Tommen before finally siding with Daenerys, partly for revenge but largely because they knew nothing would be gained by staying allied with the Lannisters. They switch sides consistently and manipulate people with ease, and they don’t do it for an ideology, they do it purely for the sake of what they think will put them on the highest spot on the totem pole. Even their banner is [embroidered](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/House_Tyrell) with the color associated with Greed, an all green Sigil surrounding the rose. 

**Rage: House Baratheon**. The Baratheon [house motto](https://imgur.com/gallery/WNNVPvJ) is the first indication, “Ours is the Fury” that rage is what they represent. Robert Baratheon has the hottest temper of any character in the show, verbally lashing out at those around him or [slapping](https://imgur.com/gallery/hP0QL) Cersei when she pisses him off. His bastard son Gendry is shown to be hot-headed at times as [well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ym7mRYyuXs). Even their house animal: The Stag, though a majestic animal is known for having a [fiery temper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNGGbozilko) when threatened. The background color for the house sigil as well is an orangish/yellow hue, and orange is a color often associated with the deadly sin of rage. Symbolically as well this house encompasses rage in the sense that of all the deadly sins, rage in many ways most encompasses masculinity. Uncoincidentally this house lacks any female members besides the sickly child of Stannis.

**Envy: House Targaryen**. Envy by definition is “a feeling of discontented or resentful longing aroused by someone else's possessions, qualities, or luck.” Obviously, the longing that’s aroused through the Targaryens is the Iron Throne, which is owned by the Baratheons/Lannisters who overthrew their father. The envy for the crown displayed by the family is shown first through Viserys, who seems to have dedicated his entire existence to trying to retake the throne even though Westeros is glad to see his families rule come to an end after his father. After Viserys is killed, the envy for the throne continues through Daenerys and the great lengths we see her go through to go retake a throne she doesn’t have a claim to anymore. I can guarantee the envy she has for the throne will carry over into the final season and create some fatal conflict when it’s revealed Jon Snow is really a Targaryen, and the rightful heir to the throne over her if the Targaryens take it. For a symbolic connection, I looked at some historical depictions of the seven deadly sins being represented by animals, and one that commonly came up depicting envy is the snake. The only lizard depicting a deadly sin, and the only lizard on the [sigil](https://imgur.com/gallery/ZJzOP) of any house in Westeros.

**Gluttony: The Martells**. This one may be the biggest stretch for people to believe but I wholeheartedly believe they’re an embodiment of gluttony from what we’ve seen in the show. Their plotline after Oberyn's arc is often criticized as the worst in the show but their demeanor in many ways encompasses gluttony to me. Gluttony is all about overindulgence of some base instinct like eating, fighting or sex. [The first scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS6PJKoJSl0) we’re shown of the Martell family, it’s Oberyn and Ellaria taking their pick from several prostitutes in Littlefinger’s whorehouse, drinking and getting down with some freaky group sex stuff before Oberyn goes and starts a fight with some Lannister soldiers. overindulgence of sex is commonplace with the Martells, they sleep around with anybody who catches their eye, they overindulge in violence whether it be Oberyn talking about taking part in the fighting pits for fun, the Sand Snake girls indulging in violence for revenge, and of course they love to overindulge in terrible [one-liners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sggmx8vysoc) as well.

**Sloth: House Frey**. Walder Frey without question is one of the most unlikable S.O.B.s in the series, but the arc of this house shows the underlying deadly sin this house encompasses, through their sheer incompetence and laziness, the premier signs of sloth. From the getgo they’re shown as an all-around uninspired and uninteresting house, relying on their lucky location at the twins for their power. The house as a whole is lazy and it shows in their conduct when doing anything at all on screen. Jaime [verbally berates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi32sU4Kvtw) their lazy military conduct in season six episode seven. The obvious laziness of this house is part of the reason why it’s so easy to hate them (besides Walder being an old creepy pervert). Going back to the symbolism aspect, blue is considered the color of the Deadly Sin Sloth and at the base of the [Frey Sigil](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/House_Frey) blue water is shown, same as how at the base of their depiction in the show it is their lazy demeanor that makes them so despised, and represent sloth in such a manner.

**Pride: House Stark**. It’s hard to throw any hate at the Stark family. They are after all the most beloved family in the show and the protagonist family, but if there was any deadly sin they would encompass it’s pride more than anything, primarily through two traits. The first is their incredible stubbornness. It’s widely known they’re a stubborn family, “our way is the old way” Ned’s stubbornness kept him in a dungeon for weeks, Jon’s refuses to bend the knee to Daenerys at first and is called out for his pigheaded nature several times by other characters, their stubbornness is a pinnacle part of their conduct. Along with stubbornness, another trait commonly associated with Pride is disobedience, a trait seen through the Stark children. Whether it’s Robb’s disobedience to promises he made to Walder Frey, Arya’s disobedience after pledging herself to the faceless men, it’s these two staples for me that convince me they’re representative of pride. To add icing on the cake their [house sigil](https://imgur.com/gallery/ndjGn) is mostly grey, a color commonly associated with pride (but the internet is particularly split between that and purple as the color of pride).

**Lust: House Lannister**. At first glance this one may seem obvious through Tyrion and his man-whore tendencies, known for his many brothel visits early in the series. Their [banner](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Lannister) is embroidered in red as well, one of the colors commonly associated with lust (or blue depending on the part of the internet you ask). Looking at the personality traits of the members of the Lannister family, they encapsulate lust in many ways, with their incredibly selfish and inconsiderate behavior towards anybody outside of the family, two traits strongly associated with lust the deadly sin. Of course what lust is most associated with is extreme sexual desire, and this is demonstrated through the twincest relationship between Cersei and Jaime. We know incest is a fairly common thing in the Game of Thrones universe, but same as real life, it comes with bad side effects in the children the more closely related you are. Madness especially is a common side effect in children of incest in the show (The mad king had incest genes) and oh boy is Joffrey one [rotten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKQbW06x_Wk) little shit, likely as a result of his parents being near genetic clones of each other. Both Jaime and Cersei know what they’re doing and the dangers that come with it but they encompass lust, and as such their lust controls their arc and almost every bad thing that’s happened to them in the show.

&#x200B;

The seven deadly sins are covered but where does this all play into the end of the show? Well, this is where The White Walkers come in. The most powerful families in the world all encompass the deadliest sins imaginable according to many forms of classic literature. Analyzing more Biblical symbolism I think the White Walkers could best be described as the flood in the story of Noah’s ark. If you’re not familiar with it, the story in the Bible book of Genesis goes that God saw that human beings were far too corrupt and beyond saving, so he sent a flood to wipe out everything on earth (except of course for Noah, his family and the animals they brought with them on their big ass boat). Perhaps the White Walkers are building up their army now because they have a mission from higher powers to wipe out mankind.

This is where fellow fans go sour on me and say I’m too cynical, but I believe that the White Walkers aren’t the overarching bad guys, they’re a force sent by the old gods in Westeros who see that people have become too corrupt and they need to start anew. Even GoT Showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss describe The Night King, saying that he’s not really a force for good or evil, “He’s just a force of destruction” much like the biblical flood. This show is known more than any other for subverting expectations and what a subversion it would be if the beings we believed to be the bad guys through the show up to this point were actually sent on a mission by the old gods who don’t like what men have become?

TL;DR: The families represent the seven deadly sins in Westeros and the White Walkers represent a destructive force from the gods like the flood in Noah’s Ark because people in this world have become too corrupt."

Only plausible explanation is a power similar to Dany's tolerance of fire. You can hear the ice frozen clothes cracking as they are pealed off his body. 

I also find it interesting that both Jon and the dragon we submerged in the ice lake at the same time. 

I see plenty of theories about the eyes on long claw coming alive when he climbs out of the frozen lake - seems to point towards some magic at play.  

Certainly seems that the night king was not interested in killing Jon Snow, as if he is needed for something. Lots of coincidences.

This made me think of the rumors that Bran may have been the one to whisper to the Mad King to burn his people, but what if it was really Melisandre that convinced Aerys to ""burn them all"".? 

We already know that Melisandre is old enough to have been around when Aerys was King, and Melisandre was also able to convince Stannis to burn his own daughter alive, so she seems more than capable of convincing Aerys to burn his people. She has been around the show since season 2 I do believe, so she is still here for a reason, not sure if my theory is right, but it is cerainly worth discussing.﻿ Would love to hear thoughts on this as I have not seen it discussed anywhere.

gottheories,b2oe8q,(Spoilers) Short character end theories based on GRRM's style,31,3/18/2019 21:31,2019-12,29,"Many of George Martin's characters end up in a 180-degree place from where they began (for example: subservient Dany becomes fearless leader Dany, useless Sam becomes pivotal to fighting the white walkers, the physically strong/muscular Khal Drogo dies as a paralyzed man, etc). These are just some small theories about how the remaining characters could end their arcs based on this type of 180-degree change:

* Jon Snow was a bastard with no family name - he ends up having the most famous family name (Stark/Targaryen) that is remembered throughout the rest of history in a song (A Song of Ice and Fire).
* Jamie Lannister was Lord Commander of the King's Guard and always mocked the Night's Watch - he ends up fighting against the white walkers and becomes the 1000th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
* Tyrion's first marriage is to a whore and is staged by Jamie. For the rest of his life, he is involved only with whores and is the shame of the Lannister family - once Cersei and Jamie die (or Jamie becomes Lord Commander of the Night's Watch), Tyrion takes over as Lord of House Lannister and marries one of the fairest ladies in Westeros (Sansa Stark).
* Sansa as a child was superficial and obsessed with marrying a handsome prince (Joffrey) - she ends up falling in love with an ugly imp, marrying Tyrion Lannister by choice this time.
* The Hound was terrorized and tortured by his brother throughout childhood - he kills The Mountain in the end.
* Brienne is always mocked for being a female knight - she becomes Lord Commander of the King's Guard
* Cersei believed that she would be killed by the ""valonqar"" (little brother Tyrion) - in the end, it is her younger brother and lover, Jamie who kills her.
* Melisandre constantly sacrificed people for the Lord of Light - she sacrifices herself in the end.

The bleeding star is the Red Comet, which Eddard Stark believed to signify began the beginning of Winter. The beginning of winter itself was the combination of the coming war in Season 2, Daenerys and the return of the Dragons, and the future war of Westeros versus The Night King. It was not the significant event but rather the omen that marked these events would come.

However the less obvious choice is actually the event in question. The future war between Westeros and the White Walkers is the beginning of the long winter that never ends described by Lady Melisandre. If Eddard Stark is to be believed, the beginning of the long winter which will mark the person chosen by R’hllor, which in this case, at this moment, could be anybody.

Salt and Smoke...

If the event is to be more significant than the individual, the rebirth in Salt and Smoke is Daenerys crossing the sea to Westeros. Her sailing from Essos with her dragons supplies both the salt and the smoke, however a much more interesting point is that rebirth part of the line. It’s not Daenerys that is reborn, it’s the Targaryens in Westeros! She returns and claims Dragonstone and the 7 Kingdoms exactly as the Old Valerians did before her.

Wake dragons out of stone...

Waking dragons out of stone I believe was the moment Bran went back in his vision and discovered that Jon was a Targeryen. Jon long held the belief that he is a stark, and while he is half stark, he never accounted for his Draconic ancestry. And how could he? But he is a Targeryen, making him a dragon, who’s dragon-y-ness was awoken by Bran.

Yep

Lightbringer...

Now this one is tricky, because this DEFINITELY hasn’t happened yet but my prediction I believe is not completely far fetched, it might be a reach, so be careful how you judge this one.

I believe this pertains to Jaime... WAIT WAIT WAIT
hear me out

In the legend, lightbringer is fully tempered when it is stabbed into Nissa Nissa’s heart. Jaime has a lover that we all know we’d love to see him stab in the heart with a sword of fire. That being said, Jaime’s history of stabbing royals would repeat itself as do most things in the ASoIF lore seem to if he literally stabs Cersi in the chest. It would be a really terrible loss for him like it was for the original Azor Ahai, and judging by his reactions to her words in season 7 ep 7, doesn’t seem that crazy. The show is generally a bit more subtle than that though, so think back to the same episode, same moment. Jaime is scared that the White Walkers will kill every living thing in Westeros, and leaves the only women he loves to go north to fight it. But in doing so, Cersi is heartbroken. Jaime leaves to become a warrior against the white walkers, possibly doing something really great for Daenerys, but destroying Cersi. However, Cersi isn’t Nissa Nissa, here is the heart of a Lion. Lightbringer won’t be fully forged until one of his lovers( Brienne or Cersi) is either turned into a white walker or killed by him. Nissa Nissa will represent Jaimes true love, whichever the show decides really. Jaime will represent Lightbringer itself tho, being the greatest swordsman in Westeros, it makes sense that he’d represent a sword.

What makes the rest of these tough is even when reaching, a lot is too vague( or for legitimacy purposes “still yet to come”) to really be substantial. 

Ice and Fire...

Has to be the wedding of Jon and Daenerys. It would be strange if it were something else. Discuss.

Targeryen blood...

Again, could be Jon. Finding out he’s descended from Rhaegar could be connected to “Waking Dragons our of Stone”

Honestly though, I really don’t think Azor Ahai is a person YET. That is to say if R’hllor is to choose, he has not yet chosen. The prophecy is not a story of one man but of many people, and the “Prince who was Promised” is the one who survives the whole thing to become the King or Queen and win the Game of Thrones. I think we’ve been unable to find an answer that ticks all of the boxes required because we’ve been misunderstanding the mechanics of the questions. The prophecy is a prophecy after all, which normally predict what is to come, not who is to come. That being said, I’m high as fuck while writing this so do what you have to to correct me or add.

I greatly appreciate it.

See you all in Season 8 when I’m wrong buckos!

gottheories,6rvjq7,Seven Gods theory,28,8/6/2017 1:09,2017-32,10,"So I just watched s7e4 and realised this. I believe there are seven characters each representing one of the seven gods which will fight the white walkers in a kind of old versus new thing. So here they are:

Father - Tyrion. Bearded man representing justice
Mother - Dany. Mother of dragons/Mysa
Warrior - Jon. Returned to fight the army of the dead
Smith - Gendry. Had to make a come back and will possibly understand how to make valyrian steel. Plus he's a smith so
Maiden - Sansa. Innocent, beautiful woman who protects other women
Crone - Bran. Representing wisdom and guidance which Bran has plenty of now
Stranger - Arya. She's faceless and an outcast. Wears the face of death which Arya has now done on several occasions

I'm unsure if all of these characters will be the exact representation of the good I stayed above but definitely think some are. "
gottheories,6o0uof,A+J=C+J Theory,33,7/18/2017 13:46,2017-29,13,"Alright, I have to admit that I am /so/ rusty on my GOT and only just finished watching S7E1 and I'm already here with a conspiracy theory so if there's flaws in my argument I'm happy to concede, but I can't seem to find an A+J=C+J theory that's updated. The S7E2 trailer, when Cersei says what sounds like ""The mad kings daughter*S* will destroy the realm"" got me thinking about the possibility of daughters other than Dany - and the main reason I'm sticking with the theory that Joanna and Aerys had a fling that resulted in Cersei and Jamie and that DANY is the valonqar are as follows:

- Cersei (presumably) says ""the mad kings daughters will destroy the realm"". Even if she says daughter, I believe it's still possible. 

- I just don't believe that, there being so much emphasis on Cersei's death as a major climax, that Martin would've told us as early as the prophecy and had it be as easy as ""your brother will strangle you"", essentially. 

-

- I like the irony of Tyrion being the only legitimate son of Tywin

- Joffrey was described as a second Aerys and the Targ lineage would explain Cersei's madness of late

- One of Tywin's reasons to join Robert's rebellion was Aerys' affection for Tywins wife

- Three dragons/three headed dragon symbolism? 

- For Jamie to kill Cersei seems too obvious and Tyrion lacks the physical means 

- Despite the use of ""his"" in the prophecy, Maester Aemon informs Tarley that the ""prince"" predicted could also refer to a princess; and the implications of gender neutral words in high Valyrain. 

- Aemons words were ""No one ever looked for a girl,"" he said. ""It was a prince that was promised, not a princess. (...) Dragons are neither male nor female."" And even though this quote is in reference to the prophecy of Azor Ahai I feel that it's revelant and that GRRM placed it there for a reason beyond the AA prophecy. 

- If Aemon is correct that the ancient word for ""dragon"" was truly gender neutral, then Daenerys could easily be ""the Princess that was Promised"" while everyone was busy looking for a ""Prince. 

- The fact that this is so unlikely, really, and that the outcome would unexpectedly pit the two most powerful players (Dany and Cersei) against eachother and have them be RELATED in addition 

- Jaime, sweetling, I have known you since you were a babe at Joanna's breast. You smile like Geriod and fight like Tyg and there's some of Kevan in you, else you would not wear that cloak..****but Tyrion is Tywin's son, not you. I said so once to your father's face, and he would not speak to me for half a year.**** 
The traits Jamie derives from Geriod, Tyg and Kevan are all able to be learned, note the ""smiles like"" and not ""has Geriod's smile"", and even if Jamie was Tywins he wouldn't have /their/ genetic traits anyway, really. I'm led to believe that ""Tyrion is Tywins son, not you"" was meant literally. 

- ""Prince Aerys... as a youth, he was taken with a certain lady of Casterly Rock, a cousin of Tywin Lannister. When she and Tywin wed, your father drank too much wine at the wedding feast and was heard to say that it was a great pity that the lord's right to the first night had been abolished. A drunken jape, no more, but Tywin Lannister was not a man to forget such words, or the ... liberties your father took during the bedding."" I suggest that for GRRM to necessitate the invention of a ""lords right to the first night"", it had to be relevant to the plot somewhere. It's clear that Aerys lusts after Joanna. 

- Intentional and symbolic that Cersei used Aerys' left over wildfire to destroy the city

- Rhaella dismissed Joanna Lannister from her service and from KL. No reason was ever given

- Aerys tells Jamie to kill his father and Jamie kills Aerys. Coincidence? 

- The similarity of ""Kinslayer"" and ""KinGslayer""

- ""In the world of ASOFAI, the Targs are the only family that is noted not just for marrying siblings, but having the genuine hots for their siblings as well. When Cersei and Jamei refelect on their youth, it was natural to them from a very early age.""

What do you think? Plausible?"
gottheories,b3tnyr,Is Melisandre's ruby necklace made of dragonglass???,30,3/21/2019 17:54,2019-12,7,"Is it possible that Melisandre's ruby is made out of dragonglass (or has some direct relationship to it) and perhaps that's where a lot of her magic comes from? We already know that dragonglass is one of the most magical materials in the lore - see theory below:

[Melisandre's Necklace (ZOOM IN)](https://imgix.bustle.com/2016/4/1/9ee1b5f5648fb2f38d720be85218587e621414ddb8785ecdf31e4c2c1d4d80d8eb65e2fe5827fd09a32660b144227345-71c9b213-2cdf-45bf-9126-ffd67fb2b727.jpg)

[Dragonglass](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/8/85/Dragonglass_Spear.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150407175621)

* In the books, Melisandre's necklace is described as a red ruby:
* Rhaegar Targaryen was known to have his armor ornamented with rubies. When Robert Baratheon's hammer struck against Rhaegar's breastplate, rubies spilled into the river giving Ruby Ford its name.
* In season 7 episode 1, Sam finds an old book with a [picture of the catspaw dagger](https://fsmedia.imgix.net/84/b7/d6/1d/00ae/47f9/8db0/3f688651150a/sam-reads-up-on-dragonglass-decoration-customs-of-house-targaryen.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=2&w=650) and this is what one of the pages says about dragonglass:
   * *""When Aegon the Conqueror forged his Seven Kingdoms, he and his descendants would often decorate their blades with dragonglass, feeling a kinship with the stone. The royal fashion for dragonglass ornamentation soon spread throughout the Seven Kingdoms to those wealthy enough to afford it. Hilts and pommels were and are the most common decoration, for dragonglass is too brittle to make a useful crossguard. Indeed, its very brittleness is what relegates it to the great houses and the most successful merchants.""*
* This catspaw dagger in the show clearly [has a red ruby ornament](https://thecrazywatchers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/main-qimg-3845bca7684f419c2fe0ac5b95087d4b.png), and since this is the image paired with the description in Sam's book, something on the dagger is probably made of dragonglass. Since the hilt is made of dragonbone and the blade is Valyrian Steel, the red ruby is left as the possible dragonglass.
* Rhaegar Targaryen is a descendant of Aegon so it would be more than possible that the ruby ornamentation on his breastplate was some form of dragonglass as well, similar to the catspaw dagger.
* In the books, Stannis tells Sam that red dragonglass exists:
   * *""On Dragonstone, where I had my seat, there is much of this obsidian to be seen in the old tunnels beneath the mountain,"" the king told Sam. ""Chunks of it, boulders, ledges. The great part of it was black, as I recall, but there was some green as well, some red, even purple.""*
* Dragonglass offers powers that are very similar to Melisandre's powers:
   * In the books, Dragonglass candles were said to be powered by magic. The light they give off does strange things to colors, making bright colors such as white, yellow, or red shine unusually brightly, while dark colors such as blue or black turned as dark as night. **It was rumored that glass candles could be used to observe far away events and communicate over vast distances.**
   * It seems that the magic from these candles comes from the combination of fire and dragonglass (a lit candle). Melisandre always uses fire to see her visions (like when she sees the dead marching) and to communicate with the Lord of Light. If her red ruby necklace was made of dragonglass, this would suffice for the fire+dragonglass = magic equation similar to that of the dragonglass candles.
   * [On another page of the same book that Sam reads](https://i.redd.it/bpnopvoe4qn21.jpg) about dragonglass and finds the picture of the catspaw dagger, you can clearly see the words ""amulet,"" ""candles,"" and ""dragonglass"" (*paragraph 2, line 5*). Unfortunately, most of the page is cut off so you can't tell exactly what it says, but it would appear that these are all connected.
   * Coincidentally, the second line of Melisandre's prayer when she brings Jon Snow back to life is translated to: *""We beg the Lord to share his fire, and light a candle that has gone out.""*
* Lastly, the scene where the Night King is created with dragonglass, and the fact that the White Walkers have a sort of immortal element to them that is negated by dragonglass, coincides directly with Melisandre's necklace and apparent immortality. We learn when Melisandre takes off her red ruby (maybe dragonglass) that she is potentially up to 400 years old, which means that the red ruby is somehow keeping her alive beyond normal years."
gottheories,amwe1x,Endgame theory,29,2/4/2019 1:14,2019-6,17,"# GAME OF THRONES: HOW THE SHOW WILL END

I think I finally got it! How the series (at least the show) will end (maybe). This is a collection from theories circling around the net with many of own thoughts and conclusions to them. Feel free to roast and toast me if you dont agree! Discussions welcome.

&#x200B;

**MAIN POINTS:**

\#**1: Jaime is Azor Ahai, (or just Lightbringer - sword of AA) and will be ""the last hero"" at the end wielding his flaming sword/hand**

\#**2: Defeating Bran will somehow defeat the Night King**

**#3: A Song of Ice and Fire"" is referring to Daenerys being instrumental in destroying the current white walker threat, and Jon being as important in keeping it in check after.**

**#4: Jon Snow will end up as ""The Undead King in the North""**

**#5: Daenerys vision of ""braking the wheel"" will come to pass when democracy, ushered in by Tyrion, places an elected leader (could be Gendry) in charge of the mostly destroyed seven kingdoms. She will however not be there to see it herself.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And here comes the ”facts” that I use as proof to support these claims:

&#x200B;

\#**1** Firstly, like some others, I think the whole Game of thrones series story is mirroring that of *Norse mythology* and Ragnarök. Following this then Jaime would be Tyr, the one handed god of war and champion of mankind who defeats Fenrir, the giant wolf. If so then Bran would be the wolf/warg Fenrir, who also happens to be bound in norse mythology (Bran – crippled). Fenrir (Bran) is in norse mythology bound by Tyr (Jaime) who chains him up with a magical chain which will hold him until Ragnarök. Interestingly Bran is ”bound” by Jaime in season one when he pushes him out of the tower and crippling him. Bran also has contact with Bloodraven (who represents Loki – Fenrirs father in norse mythology).   There is also a bunch of hints that Jaime could be seen as Tyr throughout the series: His father = TYwin, his brother TYRion. Another hint that could point towards norse mythology being mirrored in the story is that of the norse story of Baldr. In the story of the death of Baldr, Loki tricks Baldrs blind and dim-witted brother HODR (sometimes even spelled Hodur), who is known for his strenght, into killing Baldr. Interesting paralells. Both HODUR of norse mythology and HODOR of GOT are also both connected to a shapeshifter of sorts, Loki and Bloodraven.

&#x200B;

\#**2:** I think that the story of the series could come full circle when Jaime and Bran somehow face each other again, with the tables turned with who is a hero and not. Though I am not entirely sure on how that ”face off” will turn out, but I think it definatly will. I think that Bran and the Night king share some sort of connection. I dont think the Night king wants to kill Bran. Perhaps he wants to make a deal of some sort. Just think about the scene when the Night King touches Bran in a vision. He grabs his arm, but it almost looks like he is ”shaking his hand”. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. Why? Perhaps so that when needed, the lord of Winterfell/Starks can make the somehow needed pact with the leader of the army of the dead. Bran is the rightful heir of Winterfell. The jump from the deal between Bran and the Night king to Jaime somehow needing to face off against Bran is one I dont know how it will happen though, but I think it will. Maybe Bran as the new Three-eyed-raven somehow ”sees the bigger picture” and sympathises with the Wws?

&#x200B;

As further proof think of this scene: When Bran, Jojen, Meera and Hodor are hiding from the wildlings in the Tower. When Bran at one point asks Jojen ”when will we know” (when their journey will end) Jojen replies; ”you will know” while looking at his RIGHT HAND which is BURNING with flames. *Jaime will wield Lightbringer (his golden/flaming right hand) to somehow defeat Bran/defeat the Night King and army of the dead, making the story come full circle.* With redemption archs and all.

&#x200B;

Im not sure that Bran will die though. He might live on as the new Three-eyed-raven, cast as a ""memory keeper/data collector"" of sorts. Tasked to gather info from the world and interpreting signs for when the history will repeat itself and the new Night King will need to be defeated again. He would then send signs to his next chosen replacement like the old Three-eyed-raven did to Bran. There must always be a Three-eyed-raven who keeps a close watch on the Night King - another position that always needs to be filled. Remember the words of the old Three-eyed-raven to Bran: *""ive waited for you for a thousand years""*.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Proof about the outcome could also be found in the names of both some Swords and the Stark childrens direwolves:

&#x200B;

**Direwolves**

Shaggydog (Rickon) = Wild like his master who lived mostly in the wild after his parents died

Grey Wind (Rob) = hardest one, but perhaps that his rebellion was a strong but passing force somehow?

Lady (Sansa) = Lady of winterfell now, always aspired to being ladylike and fancy

Nymeria (Arya) = Warrior Queen from a fabled story

Ghost (Jon) = Jon died and came back, speculations that he warged into ghost while dead, could also hint at his future as the new Night King

Summer (Bran) = somehow,(perhaps by being defeated) Bran will end the winter and bring summer

&#x200B;

**Swords** (forged by the same melted down Stark family sword):

Widows Wail: (Jaime) will this sword also mean that Jaime will kill his sister Cersei? Perhaps indirectly somehow involving Arya, in the same way that he indirectly killed his father by releasing Tyrion.

Oathkeeper: (Brienne) these two swords in combination, I think they will mean that Jaime and Brienne will have some continued connection/do something of importance together. In a way, Brienne (kinda not that pretty but loyal and honest) is the opposite of Cersei (beautiful and evil).So she would represent Jaimes character arch perfectly. Jaime could end up killing Cersei, directly or indirectly, and somehow team up with Brienne again. The swords names could be a hint at that.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**#3** Jon will probably not end up on the Iron Throne at the end. Im not entirely sure how the dynamic with Daenerys will play out. I think there has been some foreshadowing that they will have a baby together. (Jon telling her that she shouldnt listen to the witch who told her she couldnt have babies in season 7 last episode).

There is of course some major importance with the union of Jon and Daenerys - of Ice and fire. It could be that their child/offspring is instrumental to bringing about some sort of peace with the White Walkers. Could their child be ""the prince that was promised to the white walkers""? Or it could just be that the two of them are the main tools in defeating them.

Ice magic is represented by the White Walkers, their wights, and even the Wall. On the opposite end of the spectrum, fire magic is represented by dragons and followers of the Lord of Light. While the two mystical forces are diametrically opposed—as  Maester Aemon says, “Fire consumes, but cold preserves”—they are also complementary. Both all but disappeared, dormant for generations, but now they are back and stronger than ever. This quote could hint at the fact that Daenerys could, in combination with Jaime defeating Bran, be the most important tool in destroying the current White Walker threat. This could then also hint at Jon being as important but in the preserving of the peace after, to keep the dead/whites in check. Fire consumes, ice preserves. A song of Ice and Fire.

&#x200B;

**#4** I do think there is an important meaning to the phrase uttered by Ygritte to Jon Snow on their first meeting: Jon says his name, and she flinches and says ""*an evil name*"". Perhaps this is why he knows nothing? He doesnt even know the name that was forgotten. The name of the current Night King? Or the future one? Both? - this could be hinting at  #4 , that Jon Snow could become the new Night King somehow after Jaime has defeated Bran/the current Night King. Jon would be ""King of the UndeadNorth"", perhaps keeping the white walkers/the dead in check somehow.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So listing below what I think will happen to the main chars:

&#x200B;

**Bran**: connected to the Night King his defeat by the hand of Jaime will somehow end the Night King. Might not die but live on as the new Three-eyed-raven in order to watch and warn in the future when history will repeat itself.

**Jaime**: will stop Bran/Night King combined, further strenghtening his title of ""Kingslayer""

**Jon**: Will somehow end up as the new Night King ""The King in the North"", perhaps Lich King style (to keep the dead in check)

**Daenerys**: Will die somehow in relations to Jon, something involving their ""child"" perhaps, or when destroying the army of the dead

**Arya**: will probably (in the show) get her last name of her kill list, Cersei

**Sansa**: actually think she will survive and stay Lady of Winterfell

**Sam:** will play a vital part in the defeat of the Night King (dragonglass involved) perhaps involved in a new ritual to make Jon the new NK

**The Hound:** will face off against his brother, perhaps alongside Arya somehow

**Tyrion:** will survive, and will for a short time perhaps be in a position to ""rule"" what little is left to rule of whatever kingdoms left standing (Kings landing will be partly/entirely destroyed by now) BUT, instead of seizing power he will bring democracy of some sort to the broken lands that are left after the war. Just think of the scene when Tyrion discusses the ""succession of the throne"" with Daenerys. She says that they will discuss that when she sits on the throne (which she never will) but Tyrion seems to be hinting that he doesnt want the throne to be inherited, instead choosing a ruler. Might be something he would enforce if he finds himself in that position later on.

**Gendry:** will, if the part about Tyrion introducing democracy is true, be choosen to rule the wasteland that once was the seven kingdoms. He will be elected by the people somehow, not take the throne by force if so.

**(Bronn):** will he get his castle? hardest question to answer, but im gonna go with no. No he will not get his castle.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ENDING BITTERSWEET**

**#5:** I dont think the show will end ""happy"", but rather bittersweet in line what have been stated by actors and GRRM. Bitter in the sense that neither Dany or Jon will sit on any Iron throne, but rather Jon will die and or become the new ""undead King in the north"". And that Bran will be need to be defeated for the Night King to be defeated.

Also bitter because lands and cities (Kings landing most notably) will be reduced to frozen ashes, leaving the Iron Throne, that everyone wanted to claim, useless.

Sweet in the sense that even though there was major losses and that the world as we know it almost ended, there will be a new rule, a rule where the common people have a bigger say. And this rule will be ushered in by Tyrion, perhaps in favor of Gendry, effectively reshaping the world, BRAKING THE WHEEL. Danys vision will live on, but she will not be there to see it do so herself. This newly shaped wasteland based world will start building to later face the reoccuring threat of the White Walkers, which have only been defeated for the time being. Perhaps in another thousand years they will come back again. *The north will try to remember this time.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ending this post with a quote from old Nan about the Night King, told to Bran in his bed in Winterfell in Season 1:**

*""After his fall, when it was found he had been sacrificing to the Others, all records of Night's King had been destroyed, his very name forbidden. ""Some say he was a Bolton,"" Old Nan would always end. ""Some say a Magnar out of Skagos, some say Umber, Flint, or Norrey. Some would have you think he was a Woodfoot, from them who ruled Bear Island before the ironmen came. He never was. He was a Stark, the brother of the man who brought him down."" She always pinched Bran on the nose then, he would never forget it. ""He was a Stark of Winterfell, and who can say? Mayhaps his name was Brandon. Mayhaps he slept in this very bed in this very room.""*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**...the north remembers? Jon Snow knows nothing.**

***edit: updated theory in line with discussions and own new thoughts!***

gottheories,706mgz,The answer lies in the Crypts...seriously...I'm 100% sure of this.,32,9/15/2017 1:10,2017-37,15,"Bran the Builder built both the Wall and Winterfell, but he spent much more time on the Crypts than the castle itself. In fact, he left the foundation of Winterfell uneven for some reason, which I believe to be of significant importance. You have to have a really good reason to put so much into graves while basically sacrificing the integrity of the home for the living. We have spent a lot of time on the symbolism and contents of the Crypts in the show, but much more exists in the books. There's something going on down there.
The Wall was built in preparation for a war to come and so was Winterfell. I suspect that a major factor of the endgame will be the protection of the Crypts. We have foreshadowing for this from when Bran and Rickon found safety from Theon. There is definitely magic there of some kind, and I predict this magic includes the combined forces of, if not reanimation of, the kings of winter. You have to use magic to fight magic, and the NK is coming full force with 100,000 hive minded undead and a dragon to boot. There is no conceivable way to mount a defense otherwise because:
1. Bran is not the NK. Time loops time travel is lame on a large scale and cheapens everything.
2. Bran cannot warg a dead creature (Viserion) seeing as it doesn't have an actual mind to get into. It's dead.
3. Azor Ahai is a pretty story, but I don't believe we'll see any individual in this story achieve such prolific power. They collectively posses qualities to change the world, but the prophecy has been so oversought that it simply cannot be the answer...too easy. It's a distraction.

Bran imbued those Crypts with magic as he did the Wall. They will in some way be the true barrier between life and death (ironic, no?), and I predict a twist is buried deep in that closed  section. Lightbringer? Undead warriors of ice and honor? Jon is beautiful and sweet  and everything, but his honor is going to bite him in the ass...or will it? Those ancestors he clings to are going to save him (and the world) in the end."
gottheories,6ye93v,Was Elia Martell unfaithful to Rhaegar? It solves a lot,30,9/6/2017 7:53,2017-36,16,"So there's issues with Jon Snow being Aegon Targaryen, the two main points being:

* Rhaegar annulled his marriage to Elia Martell, which according to the Faith of the Seven can typically only be performed if the marriage was never consummated, one of the two was already married, or the marriage done under duress.

* Rhaegar named his son with Lyanna Stark ""Aegon Targaryen"" which is the same name bestowed upon his other son with Elia Martell.


There's other problems, such as that of the sense of justice that Starks are known to have and why would Lyanna willingly run off with Rhaegar, knowing he was married, even if it was an arranged marriage?

While the Martells attest that Elia Martell loved Rhaegar deeply, this is second-hand testimony only.

The tidiest explanation is that Elia Martell was unfaithful to Rhaegar, and that her two children are in fact *not* Targaryens at all, at least not Rhaegar's. It's difficult to speculate who the true father might be. It's true that Elia's son Aegon had fair hair like a Targaryen, but in contrast we see Jon Snow has hair like his mother's and not his father.

This would also neatly tie up the explanation for why Young Griff from the books did not make an appearance in the series, if he is truly a red herring and has no true Targaryen lineage then his ultimate involvement is of no consequence except as a potential distraction from the real Aegon Targaryen.

So if we assume Elia was unfaithful, and that Rhaegar became aware of this in some fashion, it would give him the necessary reasons to annul his marriage to her and marry Lyanna, and given his obsession with prophecy, name his true heir Aegon Targaryen. Why it was not made public knowledge by Rhaegar is likely due to timing, with the war breaking out it would be difficult to provide the proper explanations. He also may have likely kept it under wraps either because of potential messy political issues with Dorne, or whomever Elia's partner was, or seen as an attempt by his own father Aerys to weasel his way out of an arranged marriage."

gottheories,azj7ah,Jon will die (theory),31,3/10/2019 19:18,2019-11,33,"I think Jon will be the ""big"" dead in season 8.

&#x200B;

The base I build this theory on is, that either Jon or Daenerys will die in season 8 in order to defeat the night king - if both survive this would be a totally sweet ending and that's not the end that was promised.

&#x200B;

so if we say one of them ""must"" die, there are a some arguments for each of them to be the chosen one. Besides of some ""soft"" arguments (I think Jons character is more likely to sacrifice his life, he might have been brought back by the lord of light to die in the final battle, Daenerys could be pregnant and so the ending would be bittersweet, Daenerys has been far more developed as a future reign, etc..) and a simple feeling they won't kill the mother of dragons I came across the Sam ist GRRM and writes the story theory and builded the following based on that.

&#x200B;

so who is the main character of the book Sam/GRRM writes? in my opinion it only can be only one of Daenerys or Jon, I think that super reveal it's actually someone other some people think about won't happen in so little time left.

if we look at the first scenes/pages we see Jon getting ghost, the ultimate hint of who he truly is. Daenerys on the other side has just a normal introduction like a lot of other characters, but as far as we know not that kind of super secret that was basically already revealed in the beginning.

Daenerys is very important, but has a pretty linear development. Jon instead of that goes through a lot more different stages and has this secret background that they revealed over seasons.

almost every dead of a liked character is related to bring John to the point where he is now. ned stark? must die to kickstart the whole story but also that Jon can become king of the north some years later. red wedding? same story. Ygritte? obviously. I think you get the point. the only ""big nice guy death"" that's somehow related to Daenerys is Oberyn to get Tyrion changing sides.

then relatively simple: Jon is Sams best friend, of course he is the main character in his work.

and most important, I think the title ""a song of ice and fire"" refers to Jon and his parents (Stark = ice, Targaryen = fire), you can't refer it to Dany this way.

&#x200B;

so Sam writes down the story of Jon Snow who is a ""son(g) of ice and fire"". he writes the whole story of his best friend who rescued the living. but to be able to write down the whole story of Jon he needs to know how the story ended. so Jon is dead at the point Sam writes the book.

of course he could also write a book about a still living Jon, but I think that a song of ice end fire is an epos about the person Jon Snow and is intended to cover his story until his end.

gottheories,a5b4bo,Jaquen H’Gar is actually Rhaegar,29,12/11/2018 21:18,2018-50,15,"So here’s my thought process...

Why does Jaquen protect Arya so much? Why did he just let her leave? Why has he always been so interested with her. We’ve seen theories that Syrio Forel and Jaquen are the same person, and know that Ned entrusted Serio with Arya’s protection. And now he’s carrying that out, and making her a stronger person and fighter.

But what if it’s more than that? (Also, this theory is probably just a book theory).

Jaquen serves the many faced god. Not something too crazy, it’s something plenty of people do. But what if he serves the many faced god, because he KNOWS he’s real? Because he was resurrected. Maybe, at the Trident where Rhaegar ‘died’?

What better place to go, when the love of your life has died, your children have died (or been taken away for their own protection [Jon]), your kingdom has gone. EVERYTHING has gone? Except, your swordsmanship of course. 

But if you’re Rhaegar and you’re alive, but everyone thinks your dead. And you think everyone you love is dead. You might feel like nothing matters. Like you’re no one.

SO YOU BECOME NO ONE!

In walks Jaquen, amazing fighter, but still kind. Like Rhaegar always was.

Another note is that, particularly in the books, Jaquen always has white in his hair. No matter who he is impersonating. No matter the disguise. I don’t need to even say what white hair could mean!

So, what does this have to do with Arya? Well if he’s Rhaegar than that’s his niece! That’s the closest he will ever get to Lyana again. Especially Arya, since she’s just like Lyana! So outspoken and brave and strong. Of course he’d want to help her, no matter what.

I know this is a tin foil hat theory, but I still think it could be true."
gottheories,8qs0pi,The only way I see Cersei go down.,31,6/13/2018 12:27,2018-24,22,"As a book reader and show fanatic I have always waited for the day momma Lannister goes down. My opinion on how it will happen is simple. On Jaimie's arrival to the North he will join Breanne. From there he will be arrested by the Starks for the acts against Bran. Jon will intervene along with Tyrion and Dany and prevent any trail. Jon will lose support as leader of the North. Sansa will be declared Queen in the North those filling Maggie's prophecy of a younger more beautiful queen. Jaime will battle the WW and in an act of Valor he will rescue Breanne from death causing his own. Breanne will retrieve the body and return it to Tyrion. Sansa and Arya see an opportunity to remove Cersei by stealing Jaimie's face and heading to KL. 
From this point Arya will have a near clear path to the queen. Under the guise of Jaimie she will seduce Cersei and during intercourse he will choke her to death. While mentioning the lines ""the things we do for love"". Afterwards Arya revealing who she is.

gottheories,6u981p,The Lannister plot to claim the throne,31,8/17/2017 11:03,2017-33,4,"In the later years of Aerys Targaryen's life, a plot was hatched by the Lannisters to take the Iron Throne. The plan was to place Jaime Lannister on the throne, justifying it by orchestrating a rebellion headed by the Baratheons and Starks, without the Lannisters risking soldiers or their gold.

To accomplish this, Tywin gave Robert Baratheon the information that Lyanna Stark (his betrothed) was kidnapped, raped and murdered by Rhaegar Targaryen. This caused Baratheon and Stark to form an alliance and ride into battle to rescue Lyanna and kill Rhaegar.

However, the truth is that Lyanna and Rhaegar loved each other. Rhaegar had his marriage to Elia Martell annulled and ran away with Lyanna to Dorne where they conceived a child. Lyanna, dying of blood loss during childbirth, gave the baby to Ned and asked him to take him North, where he told everyone he was his bastard and gave him a new name: Jon Snow, to protect him from Robert Baratheon and his birthright. 

The Lannister plan was that Baratheon would be killed by Rhaegar, Jaime would kill Aegon and claim the Iron Throne, Viserys and Daenerys would be murdered and Rhaegar would be forced to bend the knee and take the black, where he could be watched over and used if necessary by Eddard Stark and the Night's Watch, a thousand leagues from King's Landing. This way, the Lannisters could claim the throne as the spoils of war they never really fought in, with their entire family intact and their gold undisturbed by the cost of armies. And any accusations of aggressive cruelty can be explained away by the fact that Rhaegar hadn't been executed.

However, Robert DEFEATED Rhaegar at the Trident, and the Lannisters were forced to change their plan. Knowing that this meant Baratheon would claim the throne, Tywin orchestrated that Cersei would wed Robert and become Queen. He knew full well that Cersei and Jaime were making love and will one day have children, that way Lannisters would still sit the throne, once they were adults the name Baratheon could be abandoned and the people wouldn't care. And even if they did, the Lannisters would be so powerful now that any rebellions could be quickly squashed.

But further problems arose for the Lannisters when Littlefinger murdered Jon Arryn and Ned Stark was made new hand of the king. The Lannisters needed Stark far north where he wouldn't get in the way of their plans. But they DIDN'T want him dead, changes to the status quo tend to breed revolution and enemies to the crown. Plus he would discover and reveal the truth of Joffrey's birth much too early.

So instead they forced events using Littlefinger to have Ned charged with treason, but Joffrey recklessly had him executed, starting the war of the five kings.

The plot relies on quietly taking the throne, gaining power on minimal bloodshed, hence using the Baratheons to actually fight the Targaryens. The Lannisters actually made no enemies themselves, Stannis and Renly challenged Lannister rule only because Ned told them Jaime was Joffrey's father.

The Starks, Tullys and most of the North became enemies because Joffrey foolishly had Ned executed. Tywin has always tried to fight battles carefully, attempting to keep his armies alive rather than sending them into battle, hence why they always lost to Robb Stark who used a more aggressive strategy.

Tyrion knows Daenerys can't have children. In fact he worries a great deal about the succession.

We also know that Tyrion loved Cersei's children with all his heart and the last time they spoke, he found out about Cersei's pregnancy. 

&#x200B;

This would fit the last betrayal ""for love"" and it makes sense why Tyrion is concerned when Jon Snow and Daenerys tangled in the sheets on the boat. It would also explain Cersei's confidence when she talks with Jaime the last time..

gottheories,acj2l9,Dany is Azor Ahai and Jon is Lightbringer,31,1/4/2019 15:16,2019-1,8,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS

I think Benjen Stark might be the biggest clue as to how things work with the Children's white walker creation. The Night King was created as a means to fight the First Men, he was born of anger and hatred held by the Children. His only purpose was to destroy the existence of men, but the Children didn't anticipate there was still a piece of the man they turned inside the NK and he harbored hatred toward the Children as well. This is the reason the First Men and the Children had to team up to fight him. He's too powerful for a man to fight though, I think we will see multiple men (Berric Dondarion likely) attempt to fight him and are simply crushed. 

Benjen Stark was turned by the Children in the same way, but why didn't he become malevolent or bitter toward the Children? I think the intention of the Children and the soul of the man being turned are the key. Benjen is an honorable man, the Children wanted to save him and thus he became an undead hero rather than a villain. 

I think the Lord of Light, the Old Gods, the New Gods, and even Jon's lineage are all red herrings. I don't think any of this information is as critical as it's made out to be. I think the only thing important about Jon's lineage is that he's the rightful heir to the Iron Throne and his child with Dany will be the next heir...Dany will rule until the baby comes of age (I think Tyrion's conversation about succession was foreshadowing this). I think the important story is Dany's. I think she is Azor Ahai and her Lightbringer is the man she loves...she's on her 3rd man in this journey. She had to kill Drogo, she had to walk away from Daario, and now the the third trial is Jon Snow. 

I think Bran will reach back in time to the Battle for the Dawn and realize the Children turned Bran the Builder the same way they did the Night King and he defeated the NK, possibly by controlling the dead himself and driving the NK into exile. I think Bran will share the information about how the NK was created and defeated and how Benjen Stark was created, with Jon and Dany. After a potential battle at Winterfell, they will have to retreat south and Jon/Dany/Bran will seek out the Children on the Isle of Faces. Dany will have to plunge the dragon glass into Jon's heart, killing him, making her Azor Ahai who creates Lightbringer who will defeat the Night King for good. I think Jon has one advantage that Bran the Builder did not: Longclaw. The First Men did not have Valyrian Steel and it's magical powers. I don't think the NK or the WW have seen Valyrian Steel, which is why the WW was confused when Jon blocked his blow at Hardhomme. Lightbringer isn't a sword, it's the soul of man tempered with the love of a woman. Jon will have to march the army of the dead back to the land of always winter and keep them there for eternity. Dany will be alone with her child, who will one day be the rightful King/Queen. "
gottheories,70v6qt,Neither Dany nor Jon will sit on the throne,26,9/18/2017 14:03,2017-38,18,"As the title says, I believe neither Danerys Targaryen nor Jon/Aegon Snow/Targaryen will sit/rule on the Iron Throne. I'll outline a couple reasons why.

1. Both are unfit rulers. This has been shown several times, from the disasters that were the three cities in Slaver's Bay to Jon Snow's tendencies to need to act like a traditional hero both have shown themselves unfitting to bring in a good future with their rule. Considering how much emphasis George R.R. Martin puts on the common folk suffering it would seem a bit odd that the series would end with an unfit ruler that wouldn't improve the situation.

2. Prophecies are stacked against them both. Especially true for Danerys, notably with her vision in the house of undying specifically shows her not touching the throne despite getting close to it, obvious implications that she'll never get it, and what follows includes her going beyond the wall and then going into a tent with her deceased husband and unborn baby, kinda obvious the implications here. Meanwhile the prophecy that predicts Jon Snow's death is much more well hidden, but when the Maesters mentioned prophecies that were ridicilous and would never happen one was Azor Ahai and the other was an ironborn prophecy that said that a great Kraken would defeat Aegon the conqueror. A bit interesting that this theory was mentioned in the same breath as the other one that is fairly known to about to happen, implying it to also be legitimate. In this case Kraken might be referring to Euron and Aegon might mean Jon Snow as Jon's real name is Aegon Targaryen.

3. Historical parallels don't match up with it. As some know Game of Thrones is partly inspired by 'War of the Roses' an English civil war waged between the Lancasters and Yorks, their parallels in Game of Thrones being Lannisters and Starks. Henry the 7th who was the eventual victor of the war was descended through the Lancasters and married the red haired Elizabeth of York after winning the crown. Henry the seventh was described to be very clearly intelligent, confident and charismatic but with not the best of health. You might notice a few parallels already but more importantly you may notice that a Dany and Jon ending together have absolutely no commonality with the actual histories that the story is inspired.

4. It wouldn't make great storytelling. At this point with how much the story seems to emphasize Jon's rightful claim for the throne it just feels too straightforward and conventional, so since its hammered so much and the path for it seems so clear it has a good chance of being a red herring. Same with Danerys, her own long term endless claiming of the throne makes her the other obvious candidate, so much so that its too obvious.

Now wait, as an added point, what about that baby that Daenerys will probably be pregnant with in season 8? Well, there are several problems with the idea it'll end up inheriting the throne, some of them are the same as for its parents but also just simple things like would Danerys even survive long enough to give birth to a child?

So, who do I personally think are going to end the story on the iron throne? Tyrion and Sansa. Tyrion fits the most in the descriptions of Henry the Seventh and Sansa fits the most as Elizabeth of York, both are also the two most fit people for the status of ruler of the seven kingdoms and for both of them it would be a satisfying ending while still being bittersweet as both of them have lost so much to end up at this point.

This is not to mention other possible theories that I feel could support this further but for now I'll restrain and not overstretch this post with assumptions on other theories."
gottheories,6yqyw6,Jon is Nissa Nissa not Azor Ahai,29,9/7/2017 23:24,2017-36,18,"
I believe the key to GoT's ending like most of it's plot points rests heavily on foreshadowing. The meticulous machinations of George's mind doesn't just merely mentions things for the sake of mentioning. Shall we begin!
The birth of the Night King reveals how he will be defeated. Jon as he is presently, can in no way defeat him. No matter the strength of his armies. The Night King is powerful and strong. Simply using a flaming sword will not suffice, as evidenced by the NK killing a dragon with a single throw.

Jon will need to become something more. I think Dany is Azor Ahai. She fits the bill better than Jon. What Jon fits better is Lightbringer - a sword in the darkness (his night's watch vow). I believe in the end Jon and his forces will realize that they are all going to die. The only chance in defeating the NK lies in becoming a very powerful weapon. He would have to be transformed into the flaming sword. How?

Sacrifice. The NK was born out of hate and vengeance, by having dragon glass plunged into his heart, to become the ultimate weapon. It is likely, the man himself was an evil king. So to defeat him, an equally powerful weapon would be needed - Lightbringer. One born out of love and duty. It is my belief that Jon will need to be sacrificed at the Isle of faces as the NK was. It would need to be done by someone he loves and who loves him, and is qualified as Azor Ahai - Dany. She will have to plunge something into his heart - maybe Catspaw - for him to become Lightbringer. Nissa Nissa's living heart and soul clung to the steal to BECOME Lightbringer. It was always assumed that the sword emerged as Lightbringer, when it is actually Nissa Nissa who does. Jon will be transformed into a ultimate weapon of fire. Any sword he now uses will be ablaze, because he himself is the real sword. Only now can he truly fight and defeat the NK. This revelation will be brought to light by a combination of Melisandre, Sam and Bran. Why Jon? He has king's blood, the blood of fire and ice and is presently being kept alive by fire magic.

After doing so, the light will cancel out the darkness, and all the wites will fall, including Jon. He would have completed his purpose. Hence the bitter ending. The sweet I believe would be due to him and Dany having been married and her being pregnant. I don't know if she will die in child birth, but I hope not - there are far too many orphans. The child or children will be the promise if spring - the sweet.

Dany will not want to do it, but love and duty will compel her. The incest thing is overblown and misdirection from the showrunners. They did it with Jon and Sansa at the end if season 6. You don't spend seven seasons bringing two people together only to separate with something that is customary for one of them. Jon will always be a Stark, but will embrace his Targaryen lineage. Sam and Dany will convince him that true love in the darkest hour is not something you walk away from. They will marry, because he has no aspirations for the throne and will not break his vow to Dany, and she sees his honour. Plus they are truly in love. If her pregnancy is revealed, Jon would definitely marry her. 

She would give birth towards the end of the season after the war has ended, becaus of the timeline. The NK has broken through the wall. It will not take nine months to reach Winterfell. A sweet and tragic love, so short lived."
gottheories,9ea6v7,Azor Ahai Revealed,27,9/9/2018 3:47,2018-37,6,"I'll get right to the point, Tyrion Lannister is both Azor Ahai reborn, the hero that first defeated the Others (White Walkers) thousands of years ago and LightBringer, the sword forged to defeat them.  Now to evidence. 

First, Melisandre states, **""*****When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone.""***  

She first believed that this referred to Stannis, mostly because she wanted it to be true. Most readers/watchers assumed that it referred to Daenerys  and her waking the dragon's from their shells as she walked out of the funeral pyre (smoke) after grieving (salty tears) for Khal Drogo. 

But this can easily apply to Tyrion and the Battle of Blackwater Bay. He used dragonfire to set the bay ablaze (smoke) and was grievously wounded, rescued by Podrick Paine after being pulled from the (salt) water. He languished near death for some time and it could be said that after his recovery he, in many ways, had become a new man (been reborn). As for the ""waking dragons out of stone"", Tyrion releases  Rhaegal and Viserion from the (stone) dungeon that Daenerys had locked them in. The fact that he was the only human who had gotten close enough to them without Daenerys interfering OR being eaten, certainly lends credence to the popular theory that Tyrion is actually the illegitimate child of  Joanna Lannister and Aerys Targaryen. After all, the dragons would likely sense his Targaryen blood. 

&#x200B;

Looking at a recap of the legend of Azor Ahai makes things more interesting. 

**""*****Darkness lay over the world and Azor Ahai was the hero chosen to fight against it. To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword. He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over.***

***The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered.***

***The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew beforehand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her living heart, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer.""***

If we take the legend as figurative, instead of literal, we can look at the ""forging"" as a metaphor for the slow progress of building one's heroic character through trial and sacrifice, being broken again and again, but growing stronger with each ""reforging"", slowly readying themselves to become more than they were before. 

I would argue that that is exactly what took place when Tyrion manned the defense of King's Landing at the Battle of Blackwater Bay. He was ""tempered in water"" and broke. He did something out of character, leading men into battle and putting himself at risk, only to be laid low by a terrible wound and receiving none of the glory. 

Next, he ""captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart"" when he killed his father Tywin (a Lannister Lion) on the loo. This ""tempered"" him because he finally stood up to his hateful father, meting out justice by committing patricide, though he knew it would mean his death.  He fell back into depression and drink as he made his way across the inner sea however. 

Finally, he must clearly kill someone whom he loves to complete the transition into the hero he must be. This leaves few candidates. The only significant ones are Jaime and Daenerys. Daenerys would make the most sense since he clearly has a love for her but has seen her growing into a leader that he no longer trusts. His counsel falling on deaf ears and her inexorable decent into tyranny. He most likely kills Daenerys to stop her from some heinous act. After he does so, he becomes Lightbringer. 

Which brings us to the last bit of supporting evidence which I find exceptionally compelling. There is a brilliant fan theory being bandied about regarding Jaime Lannister being Azor Ahai. The most interesting part of the theory regards the caution by one of the characters (Aemon discusses this) on the difficulty of translating High Valyrian. The theory is that Lightbringer is comprised of two words, light and bringer, which in High Valyrian are aeksio and onos , respectively. However the **very similar** words, aeksion and ondos have an entirely different meaning, namely gold and hand. In the theory, Lightbringer has been incorrectly translated and actually means GOLD HAND. Gold hand is what will defeat the Night King. It has been taken to refer to Jaime's prosthetic hand.  Most who have made the connection haven't looked further. It makes sense and also gives the ""evidence"" that the truth has been hidden in clear sight all along. However, I believe this is a red herring. This ""discovery"" actually serves to cement my theory. 

Tyrion has served as ""Hand"" of the King twice. An office whose symbol of office is literally a brooch ...made of gold...in the shape of a hand. 

Tyrion is the hero we would never expect. So much misdirection leaves us focused on those we think make the most sense, like John, Daenerys, and even Jaime. Tyrion is the one that flies beneath the radar and therefore, in the style of GRRM, the most likely, unlikely hero. Tyrion is Azor Ahai, the Gold Hand, prophesied to save the land's of men.

While she's recovering, the actress asks her ""where will you go next?"". Arya replies (paraphrasing here): ""Essos is east, Westeros is West, but what's West of Westeros? Where the map stops. I'd like to see that"". Then she bails on the idea, gets back on her list, kills the Waif, Kills Walder Frey, and heads to Winterfell.... That's a pretty big idea to introduce to the show by one of the biggest characters, only to then be abandoned. Here's my theory: GRRM said that the map we know takes up about a fifth to a quarter of the planet. I think there is a whole other continent out there. Too far to reach by man/ship.... but not by Dragon... Tyrion once said Dragons are very smart, possibly smarter than humans. I think that when man started to hunt down dragons and chain them up hundreds of years ago, they knew this and flew west to escape. Even if only a handful escaped, I think they flew to this land, settled, repopulated, and have been there ever since to escape the violence of man (or the white walkers). Lets face it, two dragons is not enough to take down a Wight Dragon AND the army of the dead (assuming the Night King rises all the dead in Westeros, which he probably will). I think Daenerys will fly Drogon west, rally the Dragons hiding on this continent, and fly them west to beat the army of the dead. Just picture it, John Snow leading the last of Man's soldiers, overwhelmed and outnumbered. The army of the dead closes in. John thinks the battle is lost. A smirking Night King stands in the back. Just then... a fleet of Dragons roll in and torch the army of the dead to a crisp. John faces the Night King and kills him. Peace is restored to Westeros. The End.

Its a bit of a long shot, I know, but ever since Arya brought up ""West of Westeros"" It has stuck with me. That's too big of an idea to bring up for no reason... and come on, how cool would that ending be?"

I believe he agreed to assassinate Daenerys. When he saw Jon Snow enter Daenerys' room, he realised that Jon is the one who will kill him. But he's ok with it. He also knows that Jon isn't really a Snow, or a Sand. He knows that Jon is a real Targaryen, and the rightful heir to the throne before Daenerys.

According to the books, Tyrion was studying the holy books as a child believing he could become the High Septon. And as we know, Gilly found an important piece about Jon's parents in the journal of High Septon Maynard.

As he himself has repeated throughout the series: ""I drink, and I know things.""

So this is how it's going to play out (roughly):

* Tyrion kills Daenerys.

* Aegon (Jon) kills Tyrion.

* Arya gets to Kings Landing and kills Cersei

* Night King manages to get to Cersei's corpse and raise her as the Night Queen (and still pregnant).

* Jaime joins Aegon's ranks after learning about Cersei's fate.

* The Night Queen is then finally ended at the hands of Jaime, making him the Azor Ahai.

House Baratheon, with the death of Robert and all of his, supposed, progeny, is essentially extinct. Jon Snow, as King can, and will, legitimize Gendy and bestow upon him his proper name and title: Gendry Baratheon. With that, he will marry Arya and rebuild House Baratheon and cement it's loyalty to House Stark.

The first instance where his origins and true identity are given a hint of suspicion, is when Tyrion introduces him to Tywin as 'Bronn son of?', to which Bronn replies to Tywin 'You wouldn't know him'. Aside from comedic effect does this not seem as if Bronn is actually trying to hide something much deeper. Secondly there are problems with his abilities as a fighter and literature man. To know the great treatises on sieges and war written by an archmaester better than Tyrion, best the champion of the Vale and train Jaime Lannister are no tasks a common man could hope to achieve. Is his purposely dirty fighting style not done perhaps to hide out of trauma his high born training he received as a young lord-to-be. Lastly watch Bronn singing the Reyns of Castamere song again, aside from once again the comedic aspect, there seems to be a much deeper emphasis on the emotions on Bronn's face. When questioned with how he knows the lyrics of the song, he replies brusquely and with an almost pained expression 'drunk Lannisters'. However GRRM is above such simple comic reliefs and it truly seems all clues point to Bronn being a member of the nobility, and the now involuntary head of the disgraced House Reyne."

It's one of those things where you go, “Do they usually write lines that don't mean anything, or lines that seem to have significance that [are] never addressed again?” I was kind of intrigued to see what that might mean, and what impact that might have on Gendry's clout politically.**

gottheories,6ym6hj,"Season 8 Theory of prince Rhaegar, children of the Forest and Azor Ahai prophecy in Harrenal tournament",27,9/7/2017 9:41,2017-36,5,"Hi everybody,

This is something that I'm thinking about quite long time since reading the books and now with all the new information coming from the Tv Show.

My theory is that a Children of The Forest (or a Greenman) spoke with prince Rhaegar during Harrenal tournament to announce him that the son that he will have with Lyanna Stark will be the reincarnation of Azor Ahai.

Let me explain this, I will try to be as short as possible.

It's common that the Harrenal tournament was secretly organized by the same Rhaegar in order to unite all Westeros lords and conspire with them to destituite his mad father to the throne. 
Many people believe that this was the main aim of Rhaegar, he was basically searching for allies. 

The first clue of my theory is the appearance of a mysterious knight, described as very short, with a strange voice and most important with a shield with an image of a Weirwood designed on.

Many believes that this mysterious knight was actually Lyanna Stark or Howland Reed, but I do not believe to be the case.

The Mad King believed that this knight was Jamie and sent the same Rhaegar to look for it but he disappeared mysteriously. 

Rhaegar only found his shield, or at least that's what he said.

Common theories says that actually Rhaegar found the knight and found that was Lyanna and this was the moment when they fall in love.

I actually believe that Rhaegar found the knight and spoke with him, but I do believe that he was a Childen of The Forest because:

1) The knight was very small
2) Had a strange voice
3) He had a Weirwood shield
4) Near Harrenal there's the Island of Faces, a place where it's believed to be still present some remaining  Children of the Forest

I believe that the Children was there to announce him the existence of the Others and that the son that he will have with Lyanna will be the new Azor Ahai.

Whether this Mysterious knight was Lyanna or a Children of the Forest, something in Rhaegar's mind changed forever.

Instead of looking for some allies to dismiss the father, he did the opposite, crown lady of beauty Lyanna (getting mad the Starks and Baratheons) and then ran away with her.

The clues in favor of this theory are, in my opinion:
1) Rhaegar was a balanced person, with sense of honor and justice. Why dismiss all of his plans just for a crush for Lyanna?

2) Rhaegar was very devoted to prophecies (he actually believed that Azor Ahai was his first son Aegon). Surely he had to change his mind for something very big and more dangerous than his father. What else than the Others?

3) The nearby of Harrenal with the Island of Faces and the appearing of a mysterious knight cannot be a case.

4) We saw that Rhaegar left Arthur Dayne, his best man, in defense of Lyanna's child and not for his first son.

I believe that all of this will be reveled in Season 8 with a Bran flashback, to reveal that Azor Ahai is actually Jon Snow.

Please let me know what you think about this theory and apologize for my English, I'm actually Italian :-)

gottheories,6sa93w,Bran is the Wizard Who Spoke to Varys,25,8/8/2017 1:34,2017-32,21,"My theory is not supported by any written text, just by watching the show.  Many people are saying that Bran has checked out, and, to be fair, his humanity seems fairly thin lately.  However, as the three-eyed raven, I think he's giving all his attention to seeing as much as he can, thus leaving little attention left to his personality.  So... if he was able to go back in time and ""create"" Hodor, then perhaps he's honing that ability now.  My theory is that he is working on influencing the past in order to win the present.  One example of this is the fairly consistent mentioning of the voice that spoke to Varys the night his private parts were cut off and tossed into the fire.  I think it's Bran who is speaking to Varys.  I think it's Bran who spoke to The Hound a couple of episodes ago, showing him the Army of the Dead in the flames.  I think it's possible that Bran is the ""Lord of Light"" that is worshipped by the Red Priests/Priestesses.  In fact, while some people theorize that Bran is the Night King... I think that Bran may be the opposing force to the Night King.  We all saw how the Night King can create White Walkers out of human babies.  Perhaps Bran has been the power that has been behind the raising of the dead like Berric and Jon Snow.  So, whereas the Night King has made death out of life, Bran has made life out of death.  I think it's possible that while the Night King has been preparing his army, Bran has been doing the same thing.  We're just not privy to what he's been doing.  If he is the wizard who spoke to Varys and The Hound through the flames... what is his end-game?  I don't know yet.  That's what makes this show so fun.  I could be wrong - probably am as a matter of fact - but it's fun to be wrong with Game of Thrones (and even more fun to possibly be right)."
gottheories,4s7ezl,"The ending, based on the Historical period that Inspired GOT",25,7/10/2016 21:14,2016-29,9,"This is a a general overview of who will win the GOT based on my studies of the Historical conflict known as the wars of the roses. George RR Martins books are based largely on this conflict and you can see MANY similarities. From Robb Stark, to Cersei, to Stannis, to Tyrion, and even Daenerys.

The war of the roses was a conflict between the Lancasters (Lannisters) and the Northern Yorks (Starks) for the throne of England. Look into it if you want to know more but there are obvious similarities in the actions people take and what they accomplish. Richard of York (Ned Stark) was close to the king and protector of the realm. The kings wife- Margret of Anjou (Cersei Lannister), who was cunning, ruthless, and brutal, convinced the king to send Richard into exile and filled the most powerful positions with her supporters. Richard returned with an army and had some sucses but was eventually defeated by the Queens forces and had his head on a pike. However Richard's son, Edward the 4th (Robb Stark), ended up taking his father's army and beating the Lancaster's at every turn. Edward eventually won the crown but snubbed a political marriage in favor of a marriage for love. This alienated one of his strongest supporters, Earl of Warwick (Walder Frey) who ended up siding with the Lancasters. When Edward died his son took over as King but was ousted by Richard the 3rd (Stannis) claiming that his fathers marriage made the young King's claim illegitament. You can see how close the two resemble one another REALLY closely.

Anyway the War of the Roses came to an end when Henry Tudor (Daenerys), a Lancaster, sailed from France with an army and took the throne. Henry had a strong claim to the throne and was loved by the people. He was in exile due to his father's death in a previous rebellion (Roberts War). Henry took the throne and married the Eldest Daughter of the York's combining the houses and securing peace. 
So based on how the two stories mirror one another we can assume this. Daenerys will take the Iron Throne and marry the Eldest of the Stark family (Jon Snow) and bring peace to the realm. I find this to be realistic. Now for other characters, I do not know. But I believe this to be a strong contender for the ending. 

Edit: to further cement my theory, lets look at the remaining houses (in the show). Keep in mind for all houses that winter has come, leading to many issues that come with winter.

Tyrell: Lady Oleena, who is a master manipulator herself said it herself- the Tyrell's future has been stolen from them. They will have to look to cousins and bastards for a ruler when she dies (which will be soon due to age). This will leav them weakened. Due to this their current power is 3/10

Martell: After a civil war left the entire royal family dead a Bastard now rules. Her claim is VERY weak and likely will be disputed and Dorne will remain divided. In addition her heirs are warriors with no clue of how to rule- they will make for poor rulers. Due to this their current power is 3.5/10

Baratheon: Robert never had any true heirs anyway, but the perceived ones are dead. No children of his remain, minus a couple bastards. Renly (also no children) is dead, Stannis (burned his one child) is also dead, at least in the show. House Baratheon has no ruler and is fragmented and weak- this will lead to infighting. They also have Daenerys coming for them even if they do not side with Cersei. Due to this their current power is 2/10

Tully: In general the Riverlands are doomed. The Frey's are all but destroyed. The remaining children will likely infight. Edmure is still in prison and there is no clear ruler of the Riverlands. The Tully's are near extinct- the Freys were never strong to begin with but are now weaker than ever. The only hope here is if Sansa or Arya take the Riverlands (NEW THEORY). But besides that happening the power of house Tully/Frey is a 1.5/10

Greyjoy: Well it's a split. 40% support Targaryen, the other 60% support themselves. This will lead to infighting and conflict greatly weakening the house. However, 40% of the greyjoys are allied with the strongest power in the world. Due to this their current power is 6/10

Arryn: If you can't see the negatives of Little Finger ruling than you need to watch more GOT. Look- LF is a smart man but he cares little for the survival of any house. He wants power. And house Arryn under the weak leadership of Robin will have a tough time this winter. However, they have the right allies so their current power is 5.5/10

Stark: Even with winter here, the recent battles, and the inevitable coming of the white walkers the North is strong. There is no more infighting (minus Sansa maybe), they have a formidable military, and they have heirs (no other house really has this). There are 4 Starks that could rule and the north is behind them. Their current power is 8/10

Lannister: Even though Cersie sits the throne, and her brother heads the Lannister army they are doomed. They are now facing off against the Greyjoys, the Arryns, the Starks, the Martells, the Tyrells, and the Targaryens (dragons, unsullied, dothraki). No matter how much money they have they cannot survive against those odds. In addition few in Kings Landing will submitt to Cersei or even like her leaving her own power base fragile at best. Cersie will not live long, and Jamie will not either- as he will fight the coming storm of enemies. Tyrion may take over but if and when he does the Lannister will be near extinct and weakened greatly. Their current power is 4/10

Targaryen: 3 dragons, 100,000+ man army, and smart and capable ruler at the helm, and her enemies nearly destroyed already Daenerys is in a POWERFUL position. She would have to try if she wanted to lose. But if she dies it leaves no ""true born"" targs left. Her power is 8.5/10.

So at the end of it all we have
Tyrell: 3/10
Martell: 3.5/10
Tully/Frey: 1.5/10
Baratheon: 2/10
Lannister: 4/10
Arryn: 5.5/10
Stark: 8/10
Targaryen: 8.5/10

In this picture it is clear most of the houses will be in NO position to assume any kind of power. It leaves only 2 strong houses in the world. That of Stark and Targaryen. Meaning an alliance through marriage of these two great houses will be the only way to cement a lasting peace"

gottheories,7srday,Rhaegar lives as jaqen h'ghar?!,25,1/24/2018 23:12,2018-4,19,"in the whole world of ASOIAF's modern story, the most influential character to never be seen is Rhaegar Targaryan, but what if he has been seen, hidden in plain sight. Rhaegar was reported dead at the hands of Robert Baratheon at the battle of the trident during the rebellion that proceeds the novels. Rhaegar wore rubies on his chestplate to battle that day, and the only other time we have seen these gems  is with melisandre when she is at the wall (when she removes her collar she his old). this displays to us that rubies have the potential to have appearence changing properties.  Rhaegar was a firm believer in prophecies and other kinds of magic, and believed there would be a large war in the future in which Azor Ahai would be reborn. he saw poetic merit in Azor being him at first, but later changed his views to it being his children. to show this Rhaegar began naming his children after the 3 Targaryans who first conquored westeros (Aegon and Rhaenys). small sidenote, jon is named aegon in the show aswell, as the first Aegon baby had died. Lyanna thaught she should name him Aegon as he was a boy (so couldnt be viscenia). This firm belief in prophecy that Rhaegar held may have put him in contact with a red priest, who can see the future through looking in the flames. One of these priests may have seen Rhaegar dying at the trident and so plead him not to go, sending a red priest instead (wearing the rubies to change their appearance to be like him)
upon ""rhaegars"" death the body was not found, and so it is very plausable the real victim of roberts hammer blended into the crowdin the scramble for the rubies and died elsewhere on the battlefield. As dragonstone was Rhaegars home he had easy access to it even during war, and so couldve escaped to braavos from there, just like his siblings did. once there he wouldve ditched all evidence of his former life, and what better way to do this than to be a faceless man.
BUT WHY IS jaqen h'ghar RHAEGAR? : the first appearance we see of jaqen is one with streaks of white hair, a gene commonly associated with the Targaryians. He seems concered with prophecy and fate when the trailer he is in is burning and he is talking to Arya, but perhaps more likely than physical links, we see emotional links between the two characters. Rhaegar was known for his love of Lyanna, and Arya is described by Ned as being wild and untamed, just like Lyanna. The bond jaqen and Arya share may be due to his attraction and sense of duty of care."

After the battle between the dothraki and the lannisters, Jamie is taken prisoner. Dany tells him to join her or die and he chooses death. Tyrion sets him free (because Jaime set him free in S4) and Dany finds out. (This is the third betrayal in the Dany prophecy, tyrion betrays Dany for his love for his brother). Dany decides to burn tyrion alive for his betrayal and he does not burn because he is a targaryen. He is the son of the Mad King and Joanna Lannister. "
gottheories,6qztg5,"Sansa, the ""Younger, More Beautiful Queen""",24,8/1/2017 22:26,2017-31,5,"This theory posits Sansa, not Daenerys, will fill Cersei's shoes on the Iron Throne. This theory relies on evidence provided in the show, fulfills prophecies stated earlier, and has reasonable ""fake-outs"" that GRRM patently loves to pull on the audience.

First, recall Cersei's prophecy. She was to marry a king who had 20 children, while she had three. Happened. Her three children would die. Happened. She will be replaced by a younger, more beautiful queen - yet to happen. The average GoT watcher probably thinks this new Queen will be Daenerys, but Sansa is also younger and more beautful (Cersei said so herself when Sansa was to marry Joffrey in Kings Landing).

Not only does Sansa meet the criteria to be the ""Younger, more beautiful Queen"", but Sansa is also a greater tactician than Daenerys -- especially with Littlefinger advising her along the way. In her time with Cersei, Ramsay, and Littlefinger, Sansa has learned to maneuver, manipulate, and plot better than Daenerys. In fact, as evidenced by her contributions at the Battle of the Bastards, one may say she is the best living tactician sans Cersei, Tyrion, and Littlefinger since there is no one else that has successfully planned and executed battle. While Littlefinger may not have planned and executed a battle, he is still in the running for best tactician seeing as he has risen from rags to riches -- a poor boy from the smallest house, to the Master of Coin, to being the defacto ruler of the Vale and officially the Warden of the North all on his own accord. So with Littlefinger wrapped around her finger, it is not outside the realm of possibility to expect Sansa and him to create a scheme to take the Iron Throne.

In S7E3, Sansa shows leadership capabilities by correcting Winterfell smiths to line armor with leather as well as to begin rationing grain. The rationing of grain comment could be foreshadowing of the North running out of food. Who has the greatest grain and food reserves? Highgarden and the Tyrells -- who the Lannisters just overtook. Is it outside the realm of possibility for Sansa to utilize Petyr Baelish, who is the current Warden of the North in the eyes of Cersei, to broker a deal with Cersei in order to gain food reserves for the the people of the North? Far-fetched, perhaps. But for a show that constantly surpises the audience and has a ""sprint to the finish"" per D&D, such a sequence of events would not only place Sansa on the upper echelon of schemers in the GoT universe, but it would also create controversy between her and Jon Snow upon Jon's return to Winterfell -- more drama to drive the show.

So why would Littlefinger do this for Sansa? The reason has two parts: 1) He himself wants to sit on the Iron Throne, doing so would strengthen Sansa's position (and his by extension). 2) Despite Littlefingers conniving, sociopathic, mastermind persona he is emotionally compromised -- or so it seems to an extent -- when it comes to Catelynn and now Sansa. Also, such a quasi-alliance would bring Littlefinger and Sansa closer to Cersei as well as making it easier for them to fill the void following Cersei's death and her loss of the Seven Kingdoms.

Another piece of auxiliary evidence, confirmed by GRRM, is that Brienne of Tarth is a descendent of Ser Duncan the Tall. Ser Duncan is regarded as one of the best leaders of the Kingsguard Westeros has ever seen. Why is GRRM's confirmation of this important? Brienne is currently Sansa's protector. And it would be rather poetic and symmetrical (which GRRM is known to like, *cough* a song of ice and fire) if Brienne, the descendant of the greatest head of the Kingsguard were to become the head of the 'Queensguard' protecting Sansa as she is Queen. Also, Brienne visiting King's Landing plays a role in how/ why Sansa displaces Cersei from the throne in the first place.

Recall Brienne and Jaime's affection for each other. Other than his children, who are dead (one of which, Tommen, was Cersei's fault), Jaime seems to have only truly loved two characters in the show: Cersei and Brienne. Jaime lost his fighting hand for Brienne, and gained humanity in the eyes of the audience. Where as his love for Cersei is slowly, and creepily incestuously, strips Jaime of his humanity. In accordance with the ""valonqar"" part of Cersei's prophecy (only in the books), a younger brother -- namely Jaime -- is to choke Cersei with his hands. This is already a commonly held fan-theory, but how it comes to fruition is detailed below.

How does it come about that Jaime chokes out Cersei? Cersei wins the war (Daenerys losing here would also increase the likelihood of Sansa being the younger, more beautiful Queen to replace Cersei). As Cersei told Euron Greyjoy, ""Everything your heart desires will be yours -- when the war is won"". So when Cersei and Euron win the war against Daenerys -- which, per this theory will be the focus of Season 7, then Cersei and Euron will be getting frisky in the bedchamber - what Euron wants. Euron has repeatedly taunted Jaime with what he is going to do with Jaime's sister-lover Cersei and this has gotten Jaime fired up, as seen in S7E2 and S7E3. So,this theory hypothesizes when Littlefinger, Sansa, and Sansa's protector Brienne come rolling into Kings Landing at the end of the season, and Jaime sees Brienne he becomes emotionally triggered and vulnerable, then when he goes to see Cersei, he walks in on her and Euron making the beast with two backs, then in the throes of passion due to what has transpired and in addition to everything else he has endured over the course of the show, Jaime knocks out Euron and chokes out Cersei with his hand and metal hand. As the Kingslayer is now too a Queenslayer, there is a void of the Throne and who is there to take it? Littlefinger and Sansa.

Please share your thoughts on why this is / isn't plausible or if you can provide further supporting / contradicting evidence please do so.

gottheories,au7m87,Ladys death foreshadowed how Sansa will die- My theory on how it will turn out,23,2/24/2019 12:42,2019-9,15,"So I commented on a post the other day, and as I wrote some kind of lightning struck me, and now I think I how how Sansa will die. 

It's a common theory that the wolfs  deaths is a foreshadowing of how the Stark childrens life patterns will end up- and in this post I will try to predict how Sansas life will turn out.

 

If we look on how Lady was killed, it was actually because her sister Nymeria wasn't there to be killed instead. So Lady took her sisters ""place"". Lady was innocent in this matter, given it was Nymeria who bit Joffrey and ran away.

Something has bugged me with the storyline about Arya going to TFM, and then decides to go back to Westeros- with no punishment at all- she  just walked away like nothing ever happend at it was the most natural thing to do... yea right.

She even stole faces and misused them on the way back (the Freys). 

Sooo what i'm trying to say is, I think TFM have their target and will come for Arya, because she messed up the order with TMFG by misusing the power of the faces. We know from the books that TFM have a price for certain targets. Sansa and Arya are sisters, both daughters of a highlord and are both highly protected targets and hard to catch. I think Sansa will sacrifice herself instead of Arya to TMFG. She knows Arya will be a lot more useful in the fight against the WW. And her last wish, is that Arya is the one to do the deed. A Stark.

That ties a line between the Lady/Nymeria and Sansa/Arya story. One sister fucks something up, and the other sister sacrifices herself for her sister.

I don't think it's a coincidence that Brienne holds one half and Jaime holds the other. I do think that both Brienne and Jaime will have a noble death. Brienne will die defending Arya and Sansa. Jaime, on the other hand, has unfinished business with Bran. The story will come full circle. Just like how Jaime's story started with Bran, I think it will end with Bran.

-Tormund and Beric will be at the wall, watching in terror as the Army of the Dead marches through the destroyed section of the wall. They will run further down the Wall and make their way to the next castle along the Wall. From there, they will send ravens to inform everyone of what has happened.

-Word reaches Winterfell, The Citadel, White Harbor (where Jon and Dany are based) and to King’s Landing. 

-The Undead Army will march south along the east coast with Viserion looming overhead.

-Winterfell (Sansa) will send word to the other northern houses to prepare their defenses, burn their dead, equip DragonGlass weapons (and possibly armor), and a call to banners to head to Winterfell for a final fight/defense.

-Arya and Gendry will have a nice little reunion, filled with plenty of flirting, and Gendry will get to work on forging Dragonglass weapons (and possibly armor). In particular a Dragonglass Warhammer.

-Jon and Dany’s crew receive word about the undead army in White Harbor. They are both dedicated to rallying their troops and preparing for the big fight, but also trying hard to contain their growing feelings for one another. Rhaegal seems to take a liking to Jon and is getting more friendly with him.

-Cersei receives the raven and asks Qyburn if he has made the appropriate preparations. Qyburn indicates that everything will be ready in time.

-Some time passes

-The NightKing’s army arrives at ”Last Hearth” and the town is overrun and the city is raised. The dead are reanimated and join the horde.

-Meanwhile, in Volantis, Melisandre is rallying other Red Witches/Warlocks/Followers of the Lord of Light. She informs them that the great battle is upon them, and they must make their way to the coast immediately.

-Rhaegal is getting real cozy with Jon, and Jon is learning how to ride Rhaegal now. Jon indicates that they must make their way to Winterfell soon.

-Unfortunately, Drogon and Rhaegal cannot risk performing unguarded air attacks on the Undead Army at this time, because of the NightKing's “javelin skills” and the potential for losing another dragon.

-Cersei's betrayal is very obvious now. No troops supplied.

-Theon and his small crew are still sailing East after Euron.

-Jaime arrives in Riverrun and convinces the Lannister+Tully forces to march north with him. 

-Meanwhile, in WhiteHarbor, Dany reveals to Tyrion that she is in love with Jon Snow, and is pregnant with his child. Tyrion tries to look happy for her, but also looks heartbroken. They both watch Jon learning to fly on Rhaegal.

-Tyrion meets with Varys and tells him that Jon and Dany are both lovestruck, and are not listening to his council. Varys insists that Tyrion needs to regain control over Dany. Tyrion says that the best option now is to try one more time for an alliance with Cersei, but Dany won’t listen to him because he is a Lannister and Cersei’s brother.

-Later, Varys goes to see Jon and Dany. He tells them that one last attempt of an alliance with Cersei directly might work. Because with Viserion now fighting for the NightKing, they will need every bit of resources they can get. They both explain how they have been sending ravens requesting a truce, but Cersei has not replied to any of them. Varys suggests sending a messenger, and offers to go himself if necessary. 

-Jon insists that he should be the one to go alone and do this. He says that it will be good experience/practice at flying Rhaegal, and he should be able to make good time that way. He also mentions that negotiations like this are best done in person anyway. He will tell Dany and Varys to start making their way to Winterfell and that he will meet them there.

-Jon flies south on Rhaegal to meet with Cersei. This will be the foreshadowed scenes of a Dragon shadow over the rooftops of King’s Landing. Cersei will seem open and receptive at first. Likely mentions a comment about how she has heard that Dany is pregnant, and that she understands the importance of new life more than ever, as she is pregnant as well. Cersei thanks Jon for meeting her, and also thanks him for making things so easy for her. Jon will be killed (possibly by the Mountain, or just Lannister soldiers/archers) and Rhaegal will either be killed or VERY nearly killed. Foreshadowing for this when Tyrion noted how easily Jon handed over his weapons to Dany's army. He also mentioned multiple times that if HE was Jon's Hand then he would have advised against it. ALSO, when Jon said “I'll go and speak with her” (in reference to Cersei) Tyrion told him “She’ll definitely kill you”. Jon keeps the Stark blood tradition of traveling South to King's Landing and being killed.

-Tyrion, a lion, has had his ""heart pierced"" by Dany loving Jon instead of him. As such, this was the 2nd ""Forging"" of a Dragon/Child/Sword/LightBringer and is why Rhaegal will die/be broken. It will also be Dany's ""Treason for Love"".

gottheories,6x7din,Daenerys Targaryen Baby Prophecy,25,8/31/2017 15:00,2017-35,4,"So it just occurred to me, although it may be a stretch that Jon (ahem, Aegon) may be a big part of the prophecy the witch had said to Dany all those years ago. Now bear with me because I've literally just thought of this so no, I have not ""decoded"" the whole damn thing but this may be the beginning of something. With Jon now being 100% confirmed as ""THE SON"" (SUN) of R and L, he is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne so once this is out he will ""RISE"" in Westoros (THE WEST)  as the rightful king (I mean he has already risen to KOTN but you get the idea). I haven't seen anything online about this ""theory"" nor heard anything from anyone yet but I don't think it's completely out there as far as theories go. I mean in the book, in one of dany's visions, she does see a blue rose in an ice wall and that is a symbol of jon's parents (when R gave the blue rose to L etc) so he was bound to end up in her life anyways but being that he is a Targ we all know where this is headed, he may be the one to do the trick and give the mother of dragons a real baby. If anyone wants to expand on this, maybe throw in some other insights etc... Please feel free, I mean, we do have possibly another year and half before the final season anyways =("

gottheories,6trjb6,Little Finger knows about R+L=J...,21,8/15/2017 2:59,2017-33,6,"While I'm not ruling out the tin foil theories about LF completely, I think a simpler explanation for why he knows this is his network of brothels and other spies. He tells Sansa (a season or two ago) about the tourney at Harrenhal where Prince Rhaegar won and crowned Lyanna Stark Queen of love and beauty (over his own wife, Elia Martell). He said something (I forget exactly what it was) to indicate that he knew they were in love and may have run off together, but Sansa cut him off saying that Rhaegar kidnapped and raped Lyanna. 

I do NOT think he knows about the annulment/secret wedding!

My prediction:
1) Jon survives the excursion beyond the wall and returns to winterfell shortly thereafter 
2) Sam and Gilly arrive around at winterfell too
3) LF tells Jon about R+L=J (not sure why at this point, but if he does it will be for his own benefit)
4) Jon tells Sam and either he remembers what gilly said or she is in the room and overhears them talking and she tells them to look in the book

I don't feel like Bran is making any big reveals to anyone right now as he learns his skill.

gottheories,avuet1,Bran's time loop: Warging into the dragon reincarnation of the Mad King,22,2/28/2019 18:29,2019-9,4,"I believe that during one of the final battles between humanity and the White Walkers, Bran, while visiting the past (and specifically King Aery's II), will be forced to multitask and warg into one of Dany's Dragons in order to do some majorly needed fire damage.  This will accidentally mind fuck King Aerys, overhearing  the command ""Burn them all"" given from Dany in the present and channeled through Bran.  Similar in the way we saw Bran mind fuck past Hodor overhearing Meera's ""Hold the door"" command in the present.  This all hangs on one of Dany's dragons being the reincarnation of Aerys, but I think this theory makes use of a lot of previously established plot points to fit together nicely like Aery's belief that he would come back as a dragon, the mad king hearing voices, and Bran's time traveling causing ones past self to be mind blown and chant a 3 word command."
gottheories,a494nw,Littlefinger's Agents of Chaos,22,12/8/2018 8:40,2018-49,10,"***""Chaos is a ladder""*** \-Littlefinger to Varys

Our reaction: *""Wow, this man is brilliant.""*

&#x200B;

***""It's my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after.""*** \-Littlefinger to Tywin saying the same thing in different words.

***""You say that as if you're the first man alive to think it""*** \-Tywin responding to Littlefinger in a mocking manner.

Our reaction: ***""OMG what if Littlefinger recognizes Arya! Oh no! I can't pay attention to what is being said!"".***

&#x200B;

This is a trick.***(A shadow on the wall)***. We can only focus on Arya in this tense scene, because it has numerous close-encounters by Arya and Littlefinger where any misstep would put Arya in a terrible situation considering not only where they are but also whom the men around her are and what they are capable of. And these repeated moments of tension and relief makes it really hard to pay attention to what Littlefinger and Tywin are talking about. So we ignore it as boring ""Lord to Lord"" talk, something to fill the gap of what is taking place, what we think is important.

&#x200B;

So what can we deduce from it?

Well if *""Chaos is a ladder""* isn't a profound statement after all, then what was profound about what was being said?

One scene required its own soundtrack and additional footage to seemingly end the episode in a satisfying manner, while the other scene plays with our perception to create a diversion.

&#x200B;

Well, let's take the speech he made to Varys:

&#x200B;

""*Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.* (Cuts to other scenes that doesn't necessarily fit with what is being said, speech continues) *Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some, are given a chance to climb. They refuse,* ***they cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions.*** *Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.* ""

&#x200B;

""... ***they cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions.""***

So if Littlefinger considers all of these things as illusions, even love, and this is his tactic to rise into positions of power, his recipe for winning at virtually everything he does, why are we convinced that he was in love with Catelyn and later Sansa Stark?

&#x200B;

When he spoke to Tywin he said among other things, that other forces were rumored to be at play... **""DARK forces""**.

Here he is hinting at the death of Renly Baratheon, which was assassinated by a shadow creature born of the Red Woman. But **Littlefinger wasn't there. He didn't see what happened**. There were two soldiers who attacked Catelyn and Brienne who thought they were the perpetrators, and immediately got taken out. The only two people left who saw it, Catelyn and Brienne are currently fleeing the scene back to Winterfell. They don't have time to spread rumors about ""dark forces"". Nor did Littlefinger talk about any dark forces to Margaery or Ser Loras when they were mourning Renly.

&#x200B;

Later when Brienne met Littlefinger and Sansa at the crossroads, Littlefinger scoffed at the idea of Renly being murdered by a **""dark shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon"".** Why would it be a problem to legitimize these rumors in front of Sansa, if she indeed was his love and protégé, rumors he apparently helped spread himself earlier?

&#x200B;

And when Littlefinger met **Ramsay Bolton**, whom Littlefinger would later deny having any notion of bad intensions towards Sansa, we see a short interaction where Ramsay promises no harm will come to her. We are led to believe that Littlefinger doesn't know very much about him, in fact he says so out loud.

But not soon later Littlefinger reassures Lord Bolton that Sansa is untouched, and offers them to **perform an** ***""inspection""*** if necessary*.*

Would anyone who truly love someone offer strangers to inspect their genitals, if they truly meant them no harm, and claimed marrying them off were to protect that person?

Of course not.

We dismiss it as just something Littlefinger would say, and we learn directly after that Cersei has sent a raven, and that Lord Bolton has read its message intended for Littlefinger. And we forget all about the inspection.

**Another trick.**

A storyline bait and switch, which can be very confusing. You need to ""see"" as Syrio Forel once told Arya. Because these things span over years before you can find any correlation. And it's easy to label them as coincidental and unreasonable.

&#x200B;

*""I don't want friends like me.* ***My new friends are very predictable. Very reasonable people.*** *""* \-Littlefinger to Sansa while escaping King's Landing.

&#x200B;

Which means Littlefinger is an expert at beating reasonable people who come to reasonable conclusions.

Everyone is trying to use reason to explain what happened to Littlefinger in the end and many other events, but it's really the wrong approach.

His whole life was unreasonable. He knows things that he can't possibly know, with spies or not. Tyrion said that he didn't inherit Littlefinger's network of spies when he took over the position as Master of Coin. But we are quickly treated to Varys story about how his balls got cut by some amateur warlock, and a visual treat of actually seeing that warlock having been captured and tortured in the box Varys is opening. A very similar box to what Tyrion would one day escape King's Landing in.

**And we forget a rather important detail about Littlefinger's spies.**

Littlefinger does unexpected things to unexpected victims. We don't know why he had Lysa kill her own husband. We only know she was willing to do it because she was madly in love with Littlefinger. But he had no intensions of spending his life with Lysa. He pushed her out the moondoor like a cat on a table with any inanimate object within reach.

&#x200B;

He had Joffrey poisoned, because he said he wasn't a reliable ally(to Sansa), but then Littlefinger leaves King's Landing for good to start over from scratch, instead of playing with King Tommen's goodhearted, yet gullible mind. Without any plans or plots left behind to overthrow the Kingdom in his favor.

&#x200B;

**Or did he?**

&#x200B;

Not soon after Littlefinger's departure, we are introduced a new character in King's Landing. 

**The High Sparrow.**

Initially he is a strictly religious man who seems genuinly not interested in wealth or luxuries of life. The man doesn't even wear shoes. He wasn't even converted as a result of some traumatic experience. He was happy and drunk. He tells his story as it was a moment of enlightenment that brought him to heels. Too good to be true perhaps, but he catches Cersei's attention, because if he reinstates the Faith Militant, Cersei will be better equipped to handle Queen Margaery's influence on Cersei's son, King Tommen. But that doesn't really work out. And soon the entire kingdom is overthrown, trial by combat is outlawed, which means Cersei must go through the trial for her own sins and be judged by the Seven. She must even go through with her Walk of Atonement before her trial, and be shamed and humiliated by the entire population of King's Landing. This entire event leads to Cersei conspiring with Qyburn to take out the High Sparrow, his Faith Militant and the entire House of Tyrell, with the exception of Olenna Tyrell, who intelligently left King's Landing before it went this far.

&#x200B;

Basically anyone who could know anything about Littlefinger's plot to assassinate Joffrey, and could tell Cersei, and probably along with a myriad of other secrets able to blackmail her, were all killed in one blow.

&#x200B;

There is a pattern of these new characters being introduced, and quickly becoming major contributors to changing the storyline. A storyline which always seems to favor Littlefinger by slowing them down, keeping them busy and seperated until the perfect moment.

&#x200B;

When **Locke** was introduced to the show, my spider senses really tingled. Who was this guy, able in combat, smart, yet vicious and sadistic? Lord Bolton called him his greatest hunter. And he was already friendly and familiar with Ramsay Snow.

&#x200B;

Locke was actually based on another character from the books, and he is a mix between several because he has taken the place in several events and actions in the storyline which were perpetrated by others. The show's writers said they kept him longer than initially planned because he was so likeable on screen.

&#x200B;

But there is still the question of his visual portrayal.

Locke is often portrayed in a beam of light. Usually from a window. This happened when he witnessed Roose Bolton's introduction to Reek by then Ramsay Snow. It was also the case when Locke went to Castle Black, to infiltrate the Brothers of the Night's Watch and quickly became an ally of Jon Snow, volunteered to join the raid to Kraster's Keep to take down the mutineers that killed Jeor Mormont. And also in order to find Bran and Rickon whom Reek revealed were still alive to Roose and Ramsay Bolton.

&#x200B;

Here's some things I picked up about Locke. When Jaime Lannister returned to save Brienne from the bear pit Locke and his men put her in at Harrenhal, Locke protests to Jaime's offer of gold and sapphires to spare her: ***"" ... So go buy yourself a golden hand, and fuck yourself with it."".*** Later Cersei would get Jaime a **gold encrusted prosthetic hand**, not knowing this was actually used as an insult at a point in time.

When Roose Bolton tells Reek that he killed his brothers Bran and Rickon, after Reek said he didn't know where they were, **the camera quickly glimpses the face of Locke reacting** to Roose Bolton's question, but not to Reek's admission that they are still alive.

When Grenn explains to his brothers that: ""*Karl was the highest paid cutthroat in Flea Bottom.* ***I've seen what he can do with a knife.""***

Locke responds: ***""Have you seen what I can do with a knife?""***

Gren replies: ***""Not yet""****.*

We all know what Littlefinger can do with a single dagger, topple a kingdom without drawing blood with it a single time.(except for Catelyn Starks hands and later Littlefinger's own throat). But at the same time we don't know what he can do with a knife. He rather keeps to his way with words to convince people in power he can help them, and later decides to *""fuck them""*. Another way of saying **he always** ***stabs people in the back.***

&#x200B;

And Littlefinger has an eye for weaponry and close combat. **He has eyed Brienne's sword Oathkeeper twice**. And he is always keen on seeing action, whether it was the Tourney at King's Landing, where **he betted against himself**, already knowing that Loras' mare was in heat, and that the Mountain's horse would react to it, becoming harder to maneuver. Which led to his defeat. Littlefinger instead used Lord Renly's attempt at bragging by asking loudly in public when Renly was going to have his prince, contributing to rumors of buggery(that word kills me). Which is one of many things Littlefinger does that very few people question. **He was also incredibly engrossed when Arya was sparring with Brienne at Winterfell.** He was enjoying it.

&#x200B;

When Locke and Jon Snow's companions have surrounded Kraster's Keep, Locke sneaks into the camp unnoticed, finds Bran and his friends, then returns to his party. We see a first person angle from Locke sneaking up on his supposed comrades. One of the men says to him: ""**You do move quietly""**. **These are the exact words of Littlefinger to Varys in another episode** at King's Landing.

&#x200B;

When Locke leaves the battle at Kraster's Keep and kidnaps Bran, Bran wargs into Hodor. When Hodor/Bran strangles Locke and snaps his neck, **Locke's collarbone sticks out from his neck.** This is further focused upon later when Jon and his mates gather and count the dead brothers.

When Littlefinger first met Ned Stark, he was reminded that he lost his duel against Ned's brother Brandon. Littlefinger responds that:  ""I still carry a token of his esteem, from navel **to collarbone.""**

Roose Bolton asks Ramsay if there has been any word of Locke, which where wasn't. Roose Bolton says **""Unimportant""**.

I don't know about that one. A lot of coincidents that would be ignored by *very reasonable people*.

&#x200B;

**Smalljon Umber** was a strange(looking) one. He had one of the most gangsta introductions in Game of Thrones ever by calling Ramsay's father Roose Bolton a ""cunt"" to his face, twice! But he also had very little screen time.

I noticed that **he leans on the table in Winterfell in a similar fashion that Littlefinger does** when begging for his life to Sansa.

And it's also strange that **he found Rickon and Osha** out of the blue, and managed to kill Rickon's direwolf, Shaggydog with no stories of problems. Also that **he knew exactly where to bring them,** to Ramsay Bolton. Who so far had only secretly sent out one man to search for Bran and Rickon, having no idea they had split up and gone in seperate directions.

Smalljon Umber says he would also kill his own father if he hadn't died before he got the chance. But Ramsay responds that his father **Roose Bolton was poisoned by his enemies**. Smalljon simply responds with a: ***""Mmm..."",*** **as if he knew better somehow.**

After boasting about being an Umber and shit-talking both his own and Ramsay's father, he says that Ramsay needs his help against Jon Snow and his wildling army crossing the wall heading south. **A well-informed Umber** we've got here.

He also presents Ramsay with **""a gift""**. Rickon and Osha.

Littlefinger has presented a lot of people with gifts.

He presented Catelyn with the remains of her husband Ned as **a gift**. *""I've brought you a gift"".*

He suggested to help Olenna Tyrell to assassinate Joffrey by calling it **a gift**. *""I have a gift for you"".*

He gave Robin Arryn many gifts, one being a glass falcon: *""I have brought you a gift!""* and later a real life Gyrfalcon, using Robin's missed nameday as an excuse.

He gave Bran the dagger that was meant to kill him, as a **gift.** *""Littlefinger gave it to me""...""It was meant to kill me"".*

Sansa clears it all up by saying: *""He's not a* ***generous man****. He wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back.""*

But what about all the gifts, Sansa? He's like the Santa Claus of Westeros.

**The dagger Bran then gives to Arya,** since *""it's wasted on a cripple"".*(Which the camera focuses on)

And that same dagger is later used to **execute Littlefinger.**

When Cersei finished her walk of atonement, there stood **Robert Strong**(Zombiefied yet more powerful version of **The Mountain**), as **a gift** from **Qyburn**, who had sworn allegiance to Cersei and act as her personal bodyguard.

And the faceless man **Jaqen Ha'ghar** when training Arya to be a faceless man, wanted her to use **""a gift""**, a small bottle of poison to take out her first victim.

&#x200B;

**Qyburn**, a shunned Maester, another man who made his way onto the Small Council, by first helping Jaime with his decapitated hand, **a gift** if you will, from Roose Bolton, and later impressing Cersei with his vast amount of knowledge, which was acquired in ethically questionable circumstances.

**Qyburn** appeared as one of the only survivors of a massacre of Northern folk, and was helped back to health by King Robb and Catelyn Stark.

Since then, **Qyburn** has brought back The Mountain into service after being beaten and poisoned by Oberyn Martell, reverse-engineered poisons and created antitodes, created groundbreaking weaponry against dragons, hijacked Maester Pycelle's spies, then used them to kill Maester Pycelle. Conspired to blow up the Great Sept of Baelor, with most of the Tyrells, including the High Sparrow and his Faith Militia. Which lead to King Tommen's suicide. And helped Cersei get her revenge on Ellia Martell for poisoning her daughter Princess Myrcella. And now Cersei is Queen. And Qyburn is fascinated by the wights and whitewalkers.

&#x200B;

The common denominator for most of these characters is that **they came out of nowhere**, and **quickly rose in the ranks of several different places**, whether it was King's Landing, Winterfell, Castle Black and so on. And they all brought with them chaos. Which is why I called them ***Littlefinger's Agents of Chaos.*** Whether they are his agents, or spies, or coincidents that all seem to favor and clear Littlefinger's path, they still brought chaos, and **chaos is a ladder.**

**BUT**

If my earlier theories about Littlefinger's greensight is true, which explains why he knows so much about so many things all the time, there is a possibility that some of these characters have been warged by Littlefinger, who found a way to successfully warg in time without creating timeloops as Bran's attempt with Hodor did.

Which could also mean that Littlefinger has warged into even more famous characters in Game of Thrones, from before the timeperiod we have followed since season 1. I've suspected he warged into Rhaegar, to bring about the birth of Jon Snow. I've suspected his attempts at Bran's life was to prevent him from seeing what Littlefinger really is, and being able to thwart his plans.

I even suspected he warged into The Sword of The Morning**(Ser Arthur Dayne)** after Rhaegar died, and fought Ned Stark, which is why Littlefinger always calls Ned Stark ""honorable"" in a mocking way, because he knows what happened, who Jon Snow really is, because if Littlefinger warged into Rhaegar, then Jon Snow is Littlefinger's son, which was an attempt at creating the new Azor Ahai, perhaps a godlike being who Littlefinger can later warg into.

And I suspect he warged just as he died into the gyrfalcon he gave to Robin Arryn, which I believe has been his plan for a long time, since he has groomed Robin to appreciate the idea of falcons, but not property or other people, and also Littlefinger is one of the few who has used a gyrfalcon feather as a quill to write ever since the first episode of the first season.(which is incredibly hard to spot).

For me there is a possibility he plans to warg from the gyrfalcon to Robin Arryn, which will appear in season 8 as a grown man, no longer a sickly little boy. And he might ask for Sansa's hand in marriage to join their Houses, either genuinly or as a condition to not sack Winterfell, because they did indeed kill Robin's step-father, and he would reasonably have a problem with that.

And yes, all this means Littlefinger orchestrated his own murder by telling Sansa to avenge her family. He acted out his whole life knowing that Bran could be watching. And all he had to do was to act like a corrupt smart-ass and never visibly use his powers. And hang around a lot in the Winterfell crypt for some reason.

Littlefinger killed Jon Arryn before he could figure out who the historic figures were who Littlefinger had warged into.

&#x200B;

As Tyrion once said: ***""I've always heard Littlefinger was a magician.""*** *to Bronn*

And as Bronn once said: ***""Soldiers win wars, not magic tricks.""*** *to Tyrion*

&#x200B;

**Other ideas:**

Sansa might be developing greensight which would explain Littlefinger's cryptic speech to her about fighting battles ***""everywhere, always, in your mind.""***

&#x200B;

Jon Arryn lasts words: **""The Seed Is Strong""**

Jon Snow and Bran have already developed magic powers. Rickon spoke to his father in the Crypts. Arya can now shapeshift. ***That leaves Sansa.***

&#x200B;

Ned Stark might have known about Littlefinger's plans all along, and only made small changes in his path to the end of his life in order to thwart them, and keeping as many of his family alive as possible, in a potential ***Avengers' Doctor Strange ""the only way to win"" end game.***

There is a possibility that Jon Arryn told Ned Stark of his visions while sitting on the Weirwood throne in the Eyrie, or that Ned Stark had visions from sitting on it/touching it.

Ned Stark once told Jon Snow: ***""Discipline beats numbers nine times out of every ten"".***

Remember Ned's dialogue with Arthur Dayne at the Tower of Joy.

***""I wish you good fortune in the wars to come. And now it begins"".***

***""No. Now it ends.""***

&#x200B;

Ned Stark surrounded himself with lit candles when researching the lineage of Joffrey Baratheon, and he spoke out the words he was reading even though he was the only one in the room. I believe this was to make Littlefinger believe Ned was only looking for the Lannister lineage, and not anyone else, for example **Brynden Rivers(Targaryen bastard)**  
Both the times Ned opens the book he quickly glances at the **Targaryen lineage.**

Ned often sat by the Weirwood Tree at Winterfell and cleaned his sword, Ice.(Some say to wash the blood into the pond which the weirwood tree would drink). He seemed preoccupied in his thoughts, when Catelyn interrupted him. Just like Sansa when Littlefinger interrupted her. Could they both be using their ""sight""?

When Varys visits Ned in the dungeon cell, **Ned Stark's eyes reflect the flame of Varys' torch**. This is purposely done so that we one day will understand that Ned knows that **Littlefinger can see through the fire.** Just like the Red Woman. Just like Bran. The **camera also focuses on the torch as Varys enters and leaves.**

You might want to research which scenes that has candles or flames in them. It seems **The Hound saw through space and time to the small bonfire they started in the future** to distract the wights at the arrowhead mountain beyond The Wall.

If Littlefinger can see through the fire, time and space, there's no wonder **he knows everything.**

**""Knowledge is power""**

Littlefinger could be a glitch, a loop from when the Three Eyed Raven first messed up while warging, just like Bran did.

Littlefinger could be another version of Brynden Rivers, which never stayed beyond the wall to become a tree-god.

Instead a version of Brynden Rivers that stayed as cunning and malevolent as always and instead used his greensight powers for his own gain, by warging into people through history in order to bring about the perfect specimen. A perfect combination of bloodlines that is superior to all others, a god among men.

Littlefinger explained that he didn't love Catelyn and was actually looking for a specimen for his plans during that sex scene in his whore house with Rose and another prostitute. We only remember *""I'm going to fuck them""* and references to heroes beating the villains in all the stories."
gottheories,9lkfei,"Gendry is Son of Cersei Lannister and Robert Baratheon, the death was faked by Jamie",23,10/5/2018 8:21,2018-40,10,"\*\*TV SHOW THEORY ONLY\*\*

All theories I have seen of Gendry being the son of Cersei and Robert say that it was Cersei who got rid of the son due for her hatred of Robert. I am yet to see one that suggests that it was solely Jamie who was responsible for faking the death of the child. 


**Theory**: Jamie was so in love with Cersei, and jealous of her relationship with Robert (it seems she was in love with both Jamie and Robert at the time) that he decided to get rid of the child that they were bonding over to drive them apart. He switched the baby with one that was already dying of fever, and planned to either kill or get rid of the real baby. Either he or an accomplice (possibly ignoring Jamie's orders to kill the baby) gave the baby to the blacksmith with money to keep the baby safe.   


**Clues**:  
\-The addition of the scene where Cersei comforts Catelyn while Bran is in a coma. This scene must have been added for a reason, and most people believe it was solely to emphasise the fact that ALL Roberts children would have black hair, particularly with Cersei. Although it does serve this purpose, it really wasn't necessary. The books didn't require the scene to prove ""The seed is strong"" so why did the TV show? I think it provides a nice foreshadowing that both Catelyn and Cersei's sons were almost taken away by Jamie (Jamie had just tried to kill Bran saying ""The things I do for love"" as if he had done it before).  
\- In this same scene, Cersei describes this baby as ""a fighter"". In season 8, Gendry describes himself as a fighter. Although this theory suggests that Gendry never fell ill so wasn't the baby ""fighting"" - the clue still works.  
\- Cersei had feelings for Robert even after the death of their first child. Thus it is unlikely Cersei was involved in faking the death, and would have wanted to keep the child as she still had feeling for Robert at that point.  
\- Maggy the Frog's prophecy obviously didn't take into account that this child survived childbirth. So it's also possible that this child was discounted because Cersei will never know the baby survived, so to her, she only had 3 children.  
\- Gendry knows his mother had yellow hair and was a Tavern wench. In the books, Cersei used to dress up as a Tavern wench when she would sneak off with Jamie. It makes senes that Jamie would use this as a nice story for Gendry's mother. He was given to the blacksmith along with a lot of money from a rich man.  


**Why Jamie never owned up**:  
\- He wants his own children on the throne   
\- Cersei may leave him if she found out   
\- He would definitely get charged for treason    
\- His three incest children would be outed as illegitimate and their lives would be at risk.  
\- Gendry's life may also be at risk  


**Predictions**:  
\- As mentioned above, for this theory to work, Cersei must never know the truth otherwise it contradicts Maggy the Frog's prophecy. I think Jaime will reveal the truth, but as he will end up joining the nights watch, his crimes don't matter anymore.  
\- For endgame, Gendry will be on the Iron Throne as the rightful heir with Sansa as his wife and they will rule together. Their children will be named Arya, Robb and Rickon (I think Arya will also die). Jon Snow will be Warden of the North. Hand of the king will hopefully be Ser Davos!  


**Reasons why this probably isn't true:**  
\- As we already have R + L = J confirmed, it is a bit cliche to have too many hidden/secret children.   
\- They never mention in the TV show that Cersei dressed up as a Tavern wench, only in the books. Having that bit of detail in would have tied this theory together nicely.


Please bear in mind that I think this is NOT true in the books, and was crafted by the show writers as an alternative storyline for the show. Clues were planted in the first season, but not many more in case they didn't carry it through or so it would be too obvious.


All comments/ suggestions/ proof this can't be true encouraged! Also, if this theory already exists, please link me!"
gottheories,72mnpv,Season 8 Episode by Episode Breakdown (Happily Ever After Version),22,9/26/2017 19:11,2017-39,20,"Hello all. After more extensive viewings for film clues, prophecy review from the books, and a bit of creative puzzle piece alignment, I THINK I can almost break down each episode for the next season.

#NOTE: This is what I would call the ""Happily Ever After(?)"" version of events. I personally think/hope the story may be more of a repeat/loop located here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/gottheories/comments/72nsyi/season_8_episode_by_episode_breakdown_everything/

But I thought I should also post this version as well to cover the other possible outcome.

If you have any questions, or require any reasoning on how I came to these conclusions feel free to ask away. MOST of what I'm going to put down I can justify, and provide clues from the book and shows to support, but some of it is just me connecting the dots in the best way I can think of, and there might be some wiggle room in between.



#Episode One

-Tormund and Beric return to Winterfell and inform Sansa the wall has collapsed and that Viserion is an undead dragon now.

-Word is sent to White Harbor (where Jon and Dany are based) and to King’s Landing.

-The Undead Army marches south along the east coast.

-Sansa sends word to the other houses to prepare defenses, burn their dead, equip DragonGlass weapons, and possibly return to Winterfell for a final fight/defense.

-A month or so passes.

-”Last Hearth” is overrun by the NightKing’s army.

-Jon learns how to ride Rhaegal now, and is fighting/flying out of White Harbor.

-The living dragons are pretty well held back though because of the NightKing's javelin skills and the potential for losing another dragon.

-Cersei's betrayal is obvious now. No troops supplied.

-Theon and his small crew are sailing East after Euron.

-Jaime arrives in Winterfell. At first he is brought before Sansa and is threatened with death.

-Brienne vouches for Jaime and urges Sansa to take him at his word.

-Jaime and Brienne join forces and will be part of the main army. They will do some major work/fighting with their Valyrian Steel. Jaime also offers his commander/battlefield knowledge.

-Meanwhile, in WhiteHarbor, Dany tells Tyrion that she is in love with Jon Snow, and may be pregnant with his child.

-Tyrion then manipulates/convinces Varys into suggesting to Jon and Dany that going and trying one last time to issue a pact with Cersei directly might work. With Viserion now fighting for the NightKing they will need every bit of resources they can get.

-Jon insists that he should be the one to go alone and do this.

-Jon flies south on Rhaegal to meet with Cersei. Cersei seems open and receptive at first. Likely mentions a comment about how she has heard that Dany is pregnant and that she understands the importance of new life more than ever, as she is pregnant as well. Cersei thanks Jon for meeting her, and also thanks him for making things so easy for her. Jon and Rhaegal are both killed. (Foreshadowing for this when Tyrion noted how easily Jon handed over his weapons to Dany's army. Also mentioned multiple times that if HE was Jon's hand he would have advised against it). Jon keeps the Stark blood tradition of traveling South to Kings Landing and being killed.

-Tyrion, a lion, has had his ""heart pierced"" by Dany loving Jon instead of him. As such, this was the 2nd ""Forging"" of a Dragon/Child/Sword and is why Rhaegal will die/be broken. It will also be Dany's ""Treason for Love"".
 
#Episode Two

-Karhold is overrun by The Night King/White Walkers.

-Eurons fleet lands in Essos and They meet with the Golden Company. The two forces are combining and Theon is still at sea closing in on them.

-Jon's body is sent to Winterfell to be put into the crypts.

-Arya is finally reunited with Jon, but he is dead and his heart has stopped (foreshadowed line this season from Sansa)

-Tyrion tries to console Dany, and advises her that there is another way to reach peace with Cersei/The Lannisters. Dany should marry him. With their houses bound then Cersei would be more inclined to help. Tyrion even says that they can claim her child is his and he will raise it as his own. If they are married the child will still have a rightful claim to the Throne and Casterly Rock. (Legacy/succession was mentioned this season as well between the two of them). Also it might prevent Cersei from harming the child, as kinslaying is still theoretically a no-no.

-Dany rejects Tyrion's proposal, and especially the timing of it. Disgusted by him and his actions.

-Dany may even have Tyrion put into a cell under suspicion of betrayal.

-All of the characters from WhiteHarbor travel to Winterfell for Jon's funeral and because the undead horde is drawing ever closer to it.

-Jon's body is returned to the Winterfell Crypts (with Ned's already there, they are reunited again...which leads to...)

-Bran and Sam reveal that Jon is actually Aegon Targaryen, and he had the rightful claim to the Iron Throne. They indicate that his child will not be the heir though, as it will be a bastard. Tyrion and Dany will exchange looks.

-Beric will step forward and indicate that he realizes his purpose now, to pass his soul to Jon. (In the books this will be Un-Cat). 

-Varys protests LOUDLY. He despises fire magic above all else. He may even try to restrain/attack Beric.

-Most in attendance are horrified or bothered at the idea of bringing the Dead Back to Life. They are currently in a war with the undead after all. Beric points out that he was helping them this whole time and he is a FireWight. Davos finally reveals that Jon has already been revived once before, and was fully committed to stopping the Night King.

-Dany commands Beric to bring him back.

-Beric(Catelyn) performs the ""Kiss"" and Jon is back again. 

-Dany is at first hesitant, but eventually overjoyed. Tyrion is pissed off, and Varys is horrified.

-Jon is made aware of his lineage and a Dragon (Targaryen) has been awoken from Stone (crypt) by Azor Ahai (Dany's command)


 
#Episode Three

-Dany mentions that that was the final straw, and she will make sure to execute Cersei as soon ""as soon as I see her"".

-Dany has Varys executed as she believes it was HIS idea to send Jon to meet with Cersei in the first place, and he was the one person protesting Jon's resurrection the hardest.

-Theon’s forces land and assault Euron’s. A large battle breaks out. Euron’s side starts to gain an advantage, but then Melisandre shows up with reinforcements from Volantis. Theon’s side is victorious and he is able to rescue Yara. Either Theon or Yara will then make a deal with Mel’s forces and they will agree to transport them back to Westeros.

-Jon and Dany announce that they will try to be married as soon as possible, because Jon won't know when/if he will die again during this great war, and he won't want his child to be a bastard like he thought he was. Dany and Jon's forces unite under Jon as the ""True King of Westeros"". (NOTE: This wedding may be done in secrecy with Sam documenting it for the Citadel)

-The Dreadfort is overrun by the Night King’s Army.

-Word of Euron’s defeat reaches Westeros. Cersei is pissed about losing her army. Makes a comment to Qyburn that there are more than one way to win a war and she still has plans to win.

-The episode ends with Jon and Dany happily exchanging vows.


 
#Episode Four 

-Theon, Yara, and Melisandre’s crew arrive in Westeros. (unrealistically fast huh? haha)

-With the undead closing in on Winterfell, Bran tries to warg into the Night King to prevent his creation, accidently supplies the Night King with the 3 Eyed Raven/Warging powers and is KINDA linked to the Night King.

-The undead reach Winterfell. The great war between the living and the dead is waged.

-Jon, Brienne, and Jaime are the main Valyrian Steel squad on the ground fighting. The Hound, Gendry, Tormund, Greyworm, Meera, and Jorah are all fighting as well. Dany is keeping herself and Drogon as safe from the fighting as they can. (If she and Drogon fall and/or join the undead then they are really screwed). Dany might go and fight regardless.

-Sansa and Bran try to form the best defense possible. Bran is providing all the best details he can through Raven warging and Sansa is commanding the army accordingly.

-Greyworm will be killed and/or turned into a WhiteWalker. 

-The WhiteWalkers/Night King will resurrect the Stark corpses in Winterfell.

-Arya will help defend Bran and Sansa from the undead.

-Theon, Yara, and Melisandre’s crew will arrive to join the fight.

-At one point “The Seven” will be fighting together against the Undead.

Father = Jon

Mother = Dany

Warrior = Jaime

Smith = Gendry

Maid = Brienne

Crone = Melissandre (minus her necklace?)

Stranger  = Arya

-During the big fight the Night King will spot Jon on the ground and will land to fight him face to face.

-The Night King will fight Jon one on one, and Jon will be badly wounded. Ghost may die in the fight as well.

-As the Night King is over top of Jon relishing his victory, Jaime will charge him.

-Viserion will spot Jaime and engulf him in blue flame. (almost scene for scene, the same as when Jaime charged Dany w/ Drogon)

-Jaime will not jump out of the way this time. Instead he will burst through the flames and kill the Night King. 

-Jaime will burn to ash, and all that will be left will be his flaming golden hand and his ""Broken"" Valyrian Steel Sword (it was 1/2 of Ice after all). This will complete Jaime's prophecy of being the ""Last Man"" and the KINGSLAYER.

-The undead will all perish and everyone will be relieved.

-Brienne will look over top of Jaime's ash and say something like ""I swore an oath to protect him..."" (May even hold him as his body decays to ash, he did want to die in the arms of the woman he loved after all)

-There will be great celebration as the fight with the undead is over, however everyone will be sad that so many (Jaime, and Greyworm) are gone, and Jon will be in need of medical attention.

#Episode Five

-Cersei will receive news of Jaime’s death and be heartbroken….

-Everyone will be mad at Cersei for her betrayal, and Dany will be super pissed that Cersei has tried to take everything from her/kill Jon.

-The army heads for Kings Landing, but Jon is left behind in Winterfell.

-Sansa will command the ground forces, and Dany will attack by air.

-Just like the last rebellion, the Lannisters will open the gates, they will even march out of Kings Landing and appear to be heading back to Casterly Rock. They will tell the northern army that they are disgusted by Cersei, and she is ""No Queen of theirs"". They will point back to the Red Keep. ""She's all yours"". Even the Mountain will be seen marching away.

-The Ground forces will march up to the Red Keep and will start smashing down the doors.

-Dany will spot Cersei atop the Red Keep and will grow impatient.

-With all the archers/army gone, Dany will fly her dragon up to the top of the Red Keep and she will command Drogon to burn Cersei.

-BUT once Dany get's closer she will realize that it's NOT Cersei, it's her handmaiden in disguise.

-The Red Keep and most of Kings Landing will explode in Wild Fire.

-The debris from the explosion will injure Dany and Drogon badly. Drogon will set down inside the throne room.

-Dany will re-live her vision from the House of the Undying. She will walk towards the Iron Throne (which now has snow falling on it) but she won't claim it.

-The trauma of her injury will be too much for her and she will start bleeding between her legs.

-Of the remaining ground forces that weren't killed in the wild fire explosion, Jorah and Mel will find Dany.

-Dany may be rushed away somewhere (like a tower?) but regardless, nobody else will be around and she will order them to help save her baby.

-Jorah will likely perform a C-Section (so that the cut looks like a Bleeding Star)...or at the very least help deliver the baby.

-Dany will hold the baby with tears of joy and will whisper something into Jorah's ear. ""His name is Rhaegar"".

-Jorah will pick up the baby and Dany will die. (“To touch the Light, she must pass beneath the Shadow”)

-Jorah will carry the baby away....but he will tell everyone that Dany has died and that he wasn't able to save the little baby.

-At this point Melisandre will show up to provide the ""Fire of Love"" which will allow Dany to save her child and Dany to be reborn. If this happens then Drogon and Mel will be consumed by the flame as well.Very similar to the birth of Dragons scene with Mel taking Mirri’s place and Drogon taking Silver’s.

-This will be the 3rd attempt at forging Lightbringer (bonding her soul with the one she loves).

-From the fire, Mel and Drogon will be consumed, and Dany will emerge naked holding her child Rhaegar (AKA Lightbringer).  

#Episode Six

-Cersei and her Lannister army will either be at Casterly Rock...or maybe the final battle will be at Harrenhall? I'm not 100% sure. Regardless, due to the culling of the Northern Forces by the WildFire bait at KingsLanding, and the defence of a castle/keep it will be a near even battle.

-The Northern Alliance is led by Sansa, and they will realize that Tyrion is missing and is reportedly with Cersei. (Note, Tyrion may be still captive on suspicion of betraying Jon the first time)

-The Battle ensues and the Northern Army will win. Cersei, The Mountain, (and Tyrion?) will all be holed up and will eventually be forced to surrender.

-Flash forward, Time (more months?) passes, everyone is rebuilding.

-Jon and Dany have left to live a new simple life, away from everyone else. They have given up their “rights” and titles. Jon and Dany vouched for Sansa to be the new Queen. They will be at the Wall and have taken the black, or more likely are living in Dorne, in a house with a Red Door and a Lemon Tree outside it.

-Sansa has been declared The Queen of Westeros.

-Kings Landing and The Wall are being rebuilt.

-Brienne is the Lord Commander of the QueensGuard, she will fill out Jaime's page in the Lord Commander book with a smile on her face, proud of everything that he did.

-Davos is now Hand to the Queen.

-Bran will be declared/forced to be Lord of Winterfell..and Meera is on her way to becoming Lady of Winterfell (?). Afterall, a Stark must always be in Winterfell.

-Gendry will likely be legitimized and be Lord of Storm's End

-Theon or Asha/Yara will be Lord/Lady of Pyke

-The Final War Trial will happen....most characters will be in attendance for this. Sansa will be sitting over the trial, and Bran will be by her side.

-Cersei and Tyrion will come out in shackles. Possibly shackled together. Cersei will be very pregnant by this point.

-Cersei will be up first, she will be accused of her crimes but she will retort with something along the lines of ""Sheep can't judge a Lion, only the Gods can judge me. I DEMAND trial by combat."" She will choose the Mountain as her Champion, and he will be retrieved from the prison cells.

-Sansa will look over the crowd and the Hound will step forward. Which will lead to...CLEGANEBOWL!

-The fight will be fantastic, and the Hound will win. Cersei will be told that she will be executed immediately after the trial. NOTE: This battle MAY take place prior to the final capture/defeat of Cersei.

-Tyrion will be told of the crimes he is accused of. Tyrion will explain that he has been tormented and cursed ever since he committed his first true crime. When he became a kinslayer, and killed his own father. He will explain that everything he did was to redeem himself to his family, and protecting his future niece/nephew was the only way he could do it. He will also profess that he was in love with Dany, and wanted to marry her as well. He will explain that he also cared for Jon and nothing could make him feel worse than he feels already.

-Bran will chime in ""Actually, Tywin wasn't your father.""

-At first Tyrion will be very relieved. That means that he ISN'T a kinslayer. He ISN'T the monster he always thought he was.

-Then Bran will reveal that his father was actually Aerys Targaryen.

-Tyrion will break down. That means that he actually betrayed and was responsible for the death of his half-nephew (Jon), his half-sister (Dany), and their child.(Although all 3 ended up living) He actually betrayed half his family in the name of protecting the other half of his family.

-As Tyrion is breaking down, Cersei will make some comment that ignites him. Probably something like ""I knew a disgusting dwarf like you couldn't be my true brother"" or ""you still killed our mother"". Whatever it is, he will lash out at Cersei and strangle her with the shackles around his wrist. He will scream at her and choke her until she stops breathing. Cersei thought the prophecy was broken and stopped fearing Tyrion when she was pregnant with her 4th baby....but she never delivered the baby, and was killed by the Valonqar/Younger Brother.

-Sansa will be disgusted with Tyrion and his actions, but will give him one last chance at redemption, which Tyrion will take.

-He will choose to take The Black. His final shot will be staring off of The Wall. He will finally be able to ""brood"" as well as Jon. Filled with anguish and inner conflict.

-Arya will turn down the chance to finally be a ""Knight"" in the Queensguard. Instead she will travel West to see what is West of Westeros.

-Sam will return to the Citadel and will make some comment to the other Maesters about how it will take him a long time to write these event down. Some cheesy line about calling it ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" or ""A Game of Thrones"". He may become GrandMaester and reside in KingsLanding/Winterfell/CastleBlack.

-More Time passes, and the Children of the Forest come to meet Bran.

-They thank him for everything that he has done, but they point out that The Knight King wasn't purely evil. He was actually trying to protect them from ""The Great Other"".

-As they talk, we see a scene of Jon and Dany with their child.

-He is alive and well....BUT....since Jon and possibly Dany died and were brought back to life using Fire/Blood Magic....something isn't quite right.

-We look closer at the child, and there is something off about his eyes. The camera zooms in and we see that Rhaegar’s eyes are the same design and pattern as The Night's King, but instead of glowing Blue, the eyes are glowing Red. After all, he isn't the NightKing...he is LightBringer! 

-The COTF tell us (and Bran) that the child is going to usher in a Long Summer filled with ""Fire and Blood"". 

-They will tell Bran that they need his help to stop the Great Other...and the show ends.
LATE EDIT: Bran may literally say something like ""I'll help you. Don't worry about the ominous long summer....Winter is Coming"" as the final line of the show.

gottheories,6vk7uc,Not so much a theory but an observation that I am shocked no one is discussing.,22,8/23/2017 16:43,2017-34,15,"The scene where the Jon Snow and the beyond the wall party attack a smaller group of wights and a White Walker is quite interesting. All the wights collapsed after the WW was killed by Jon except 1. I initially thought this was odd but maybe this group was borrowing another wight from another WW contingent for whatever reason. Then has anyone noticed that after the Hound was stupid and threw the rock, signifying that the lake was frozen over, some of the wights surrounding them were not attacking. Instead of attacking, they were trying to free the captured wight. Obviously, there were many wights just attacking the group but there were quite a few seemingly trying to free the wight. Why is this? It shouldn't matter.
After rewatching the episode, I also noticed that when the Hound kicked the captured wight, it seemed as if the surround wights felt its pain as well. I was reading an article where the writers stated that we would find out more of the inner workings of the WW. It seems that there could be connection to the wights trying to free the captured one coupled with the surrounding wights seemingly feeling the pain of the captured wight getting kicked and a way to defeat the NK and his wight army. 
Lastly, there is a lot of talk of the Wall being coated with magic of what have you and that the WW can not cross until the magic is broken. Well we now have 2 instances (the captured wight and the wight in season 2 I believe) crossing the Wall with no implications. Yes, they are wights and not WW but come on. I cant see how that makes a difference.
All in all, I have given you all nothing really in the spirit of theory spitting but has anyone else noticed/thought about the captured wight and all the weird things I pointed out previously?

gottheories,8jg4he,"Euron will kill Jon, but will he rise again?",21,5/14/2018 21:37,2018-20,16,"Last season, when Samwell was trying to convince the maesters to gather all the writings about the white walkers and they dismissed him, on his way out they spoke of a prophesy that never happened.  That the drowned god will rise from the water and kill Aegon Targaryon.  They dismissed it as never happening.  But they didn't know about Jon/Aegon.  Euron could represent the drowned God.  If so, I believe Jon could rise again and maybe that is Beric Dondarrion's purpose.  He said he didn't know why the LOL keeps raising him, maybe this is why.  I also believe that Beric is playing the part of Lady Stoneheart and perhaps this is a moment of tenderness that Catelyn/Lady Stoneheart shows Jon and gives up her life for him.  Just a thought.  I think this because why would they have filmed that prophecy with the maesters if it wasn't important and why is Euron even around?  "

when i was watching interviews with George r.r Martin and i heard that GRRM was really into lotr aswell and after the season 5 finale i started thinking about the similarities between GOT and LOTR and i came upon aragorn and jon snow and if you compare these two there are really so much things they have in common.
to start with: they both grew up with other people instead of their parents
they are both legendary sword fighters
jon snow is commander of the nights watch and aragorn is a ranger from the dunedain.
they both have the kingsblood, aragorn is the rightful king of gondor, and if the R+L=J theory is right, so does jon.
when I saw all of these similarities i thought about the time that LOTR made us believe aragorn was dead and this is the same as with jon snow now, and when in LOTR the battle of helmsdeep was almost happening aragorn was suddenly alive, so I expect jon snow to be resurrected by melissandre or smthing like that.
Just because George R.R. Martin was an admirer of J.R.R Tolkiens books
this is why i believe Jon Snow will return!

asoiafcirclejerk,6vi9t6,How the show literally ruined my life.,176,8/23/2017 11:15,2017-34,36,"It was a month ago. I had just only watched the first episode of Season 7 when my mother called out to me. ""Mark, it's time for dinner!"" she announced. My blood started boiling and I could hear it raging inside my veins. How dare that bitch call me Mark Mylod. I started slamming my fist into my desk and she was confused. ""What are you doing Mark?"" she said again.

This was too much for me. I started screeching and throwing around my stuff in rage and she had to call the cops in order to restrain me. The next week, after watching episode 2 I was so angry with the show every time a co-worker told me about ""Game of Thrones"" I threatened him with his life. Then, my best friend called me. ""Hey Mark, it's David, Dan and the girls asked me if you wanted to come to watch a movie tonight"" I stopped listening. ""Did that faggot just compare me to Deus&Duplo?"" I thought.

I took my dad's handgun and car and headed to David's house. When he opened the door he looked confused. ""Why did you bring a gun along, Mark?"" he sounded worried. First he called me D&D, now Mark Mylod. I raised the gun to his temple and said ""First you assassinate the characters of Barristan and Stannis and then you compare me to your agency-less ass"". David begged for his life but I ignored him. ""So did beg Victarion when you cut his character. More or less."" and I pulled the trigger. His body lay in a pool of blood, reminding me of the butchered Tower of Joy scene.

When I returned home my brother asked me ""Hey, did you watch the new Game of Thrones episode? Euron was so cooool!!!!"" That was too much, even for me. How dare he compliment the second holocaust? (season 7) ""HE HAS NO EYE PATCH AND NO NUANCE YOU SHOWNLY FUCKER"" I said while beating him to a pulp. After he was sent to the hospital I rewatched the latest episode for the 5th time. 

When I heard police sirens outside my house I took my phone and jumped off the back window. ""This is like AFFC's travel logs, so subtle!"" I thought and giggled. I was on the run and after a week I looked like a hobo and I was reminded of Jaime's redemption arc that Hitler&Himmler left out of the show. I went from backyard to backyard to try and steal wi-fi so I could watch the leaked episodes so I could complain about them on r/asoiaf.

I was walking around the avenue when I noticed a store called ""Emilia's hardware"". That bitched Emilia Clarke and her eyebrows literally destroyed my life. I bought some gasoline from the gas station and poured it around Emilia's store. Despite the Clerk calling the cops, I managed to lit it to fire while proclaiming ""What say you in your defense?""

The cops caught me and headed me to court. When the judge proclaimed me guilty of arson, assault and murder and sentenced me to life without parole, I told him ""I demand a trial by combat, you fookin kneeler"". I was in my cell 23 hours a day and I managed to smuggle a piece of chalk. I scribbled every ASOIAF quote in the walls that I memorized from my 30 re-reads. Before going to sleep I muttered to myself ""Polliver. Gregor Clegane. Raff the Sweetling. Tickler. Valar Morghulis."" followed by Septon Meribald's speech.

When a big black inmate pulled out his cock to take a piss I giggled because his pink mast wasn't pink. He beat me but it was worth annoying the shownly. When I got access to wi-fi I watched the leaked episode 6. I couldn't believe in my eyes. My ears started bleeding, my stomach started exploding and I cried for 3 days straight. How could they butcher the best book series of all time?

That was the final straw. I prepared the noose to hang myself. I thought to myself that it wasn't me who was killing myself, but Lady Stoneheart because of how nuanced her character is. As I was about to let my final breath, the warden stormed my cell and cut the noose.

Even in those darkest days, I cannot escape D&D's Deus ex Machina."

*Keep that in mind.*

Reading back over [book], I stumbled across this line
> insert quote here

Now, while this may appear to be completely inconsequential, you may recall that in [other book] [character] said:
> insert quote, completely unrelated

**But the rabbit hole goes deeper!** Look at this:
> quote 

and
> quote

Now things really start getting intriguing. Why would [character] and [character] *both* say similar things? Could this **blow** open [theory]? I think so, but **hold on to your pants.**

Think back to the opening GRRM quote. Now consider how [philosopher, Bible, world mythology, or cat food nutritional facts] says [barely related information]. 

In particular: 
> extremely long quote that nobody wants to read

> and I mean *extremely* long

We know that GRRM likes [thing] and [philosopher, Bible, world mythology, or cat food nutritional facts] says something similar. Moreover, we've already blown a gigantic hole in [theory]. **We need a new theory to explain all of this.**

So, here's a rock-solid new theory for what I think this means for [insignificant detail] in TWOW. [2000-word proposal for a theory that barely connects anything together in any convincing way, yet is surrounded by quotes. People like quotes.]

For good measure, here are four more grossly contradictory quotes:
> quote

> quote

> quote

> quote

There is **no other possible explanation** than [new theory] for why these quotes contradict each other. It can't all be a coincidence. "
